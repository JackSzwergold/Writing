## Greedo
### Purchased at Youth World on Brighton Beach Avenue

By Jack Szwergold

Oh Greedo! Of all of the scrub figures I bought when Kenner released 8 more figures to add to the original 12 figure line in 1978, you were my favorite.

For one, the green coloring on the body was really nice and bright; reminiscent of some of the Japanese imported toys I knew and loved. Also, this figure looked like a truly weird crappy alien. It was fun to play around with Greedo and Walrus man and have them conspire about ways to get back at everyone else like Luke and Han.

The day I bought Greedo was need the end of some sort of school period. Maybe it was just before spring break or maybe it was just at the end of the school year in June. Regardless, I remember excitedly buying this figure from Youth World, crossing Brighton 2nd Street and running into some kids from school.

“Hey,” one of them said, “What do have there?” I showed them my Greedo figure and one of them responded that they never even got to see *Star Wars* but thought this figure looked cool. “So, are you going to that after school gym thing?” one of them asked me' “No,” I responded, “I’m going to head home.” “Are you positive?” they asked, and I responded, “Yes, I’m tired.” And with that I headed home.

An after school athletics program sounds cool, but some of the gym teachers in my elementary school creeped me out. Especially the ones who ran this after-school program; so I didn’t feel safe being with them.

But hey! I had Greedo! And happily headed home to show him off to my dad who would complain about my spending but—ultimately—was cool with me buying stuff like this as long as I could limit purchases to what I saved from my weekly allowance.
