## Greedo (Youth World)

By Jack Szwergold

I had more mixed feelings about Greedo. Remember buying the figure at some point in the school year when we all had time off. Maybe before spring break or summer break. Ran into some kids from school on the street who said I should go to some after school gym class or something, but I didnâ€™t trust the gym teachers there so I made some excuse to go home and open up Greedo.
