## Boba Fett
### Mail Away Offer from Kenner

By Jack Szwergold

Boba Fett was a very cool figure to score in 1979 for a few reasons:

* One, the one way to get this figure was via a mail-away offer where you had to send 4 proof of purchase seals to Kenner and then wait 6-8 weeks and then this small, white box would show up in the mail containing the figure with not much else.
* Two, the figure was some “mysterious” character from the next movie which—at the time—was only known as <i>Star Wars II</i> which lent it an air of mystery.
* Three, the figure itself looked very cool and even had a spring powered rocket in it’s back pack that was reminiscent of some of the cool Japanese robot action figures of the 1970s.

Sadly, by the time the figure arrived the missile firing mechanism was removed after some kid—or bunch of kids—choked on one from a *Battlestar Galactica* toy; toy manufacturers felt the market pressure from the Consumer Products Safety Commission and neutered all missile firing toys as a result.

All that said, Boba Fett was still a very cool toy to own despite the fact the “rocket firing back pack” didn’t actually end up firing any rocket.
