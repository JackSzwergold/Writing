## Boba Fett (Mail Away Offer)

By Jack Szwergold

Awesome figure! First mail away figure that had a “mysterious” role in the next movie, *The Empire Strikes Back*. Had to save proof of purchase points from other figures I collected and send them in with a small shipping and handling fee to Kenner HQ and wait 6 weeks to get this figure in the mail in a small, white box. Such a cool thing! Except for the fact the missile firing backpack wasn’t going to fire a missile since Kenner—and other toy companies—neutered missile firing toys after some kid choked on one from a *Battlestar Galactica* toy.
