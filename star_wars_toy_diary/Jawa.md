## Jawa (Some Toy Store on 181st Street)

By Jack Szwergold

These were some of the hardest figures to get. When my brother heard I wanted these, he bought them from a toy store in Washington Heights. I liked them but really wanted to check out this other toy store myself; my brother insisted I should “not worry” and just let him buy figures for me if I wanted any more. I pushed harder and he relented to show me the store. They had tons of stuff, but my brother was constantly grumbling about why I would want to check out the toys myself. The idea of letting a kid explore/collect on their own was a foreign idea to him.
