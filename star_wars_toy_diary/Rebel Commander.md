## Rebel Commander (Lee’s Toys/Variety on Avenue U)

By Jack Szwergold

Another score from a new store: *Lee’s Toys/Variety* on Avenue U near Coney Island Avenue. Another cool store to help me stretch my wings and explore other neighborhoods as a kid. A short ride on the B-68 and I was there. And honestly, they had a crappy selection of figures, but I spotted this one and decided to add it to my mix. If I had a Han Solo figure bundled up for winter combat, might as well have had a commander figure as well.
