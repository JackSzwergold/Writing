## Han Solo
### Purchased at Cameo Stationery on Brighton Beach Avenue

By Jack Szwergold

Don’t know when it was—it might have been one of the first times I ventured into *Cameo Stationery*—but I remember seeing this Han Solo figure hanging off a pegboard right beneath the cash register.

This was weird to me since Cameo was just a stationery store filled with lots of greeting cards and girlie stuff. There were some school supplies there, so I knew they were a good location for stuff like that. But not for stuff like *Star Wars* action figures.

Anyway, I was happy to score Han Solo since at that point I only had a few figures and all of them had lightsabers, except for a Stormtrooper. So Han Solo was one of the first figures I scored that was a good guy that had a blaster gun. His head was kind of small compared to other figures, but he didn’t look too gimpy.
