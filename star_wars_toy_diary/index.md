# Star Wars Toy Diary

This section is a placeholder for memories connected to collection *Star Wars* action figures back in the 1970s. At this point, it’s here mainly to motivate me to actually sit down and write about them already.

## 1977/1978

#### Luke Skywalker (Youth World)

Very first figure I bought with a begged for advance from my allowance.

#### Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi (Youth World)

Bought from Youth World as well.

#### Sand People (Youth World)

Got two of these since hey… There are more than one of these nameless characters in the film.

#### Artoo-Detoo (Youth World)

Really liked this figure since it was small, made clicking noises and was easy to carry in my pocket.

#### See-Threepio (Youth World)

Bought this figure and had mixed feelings about it: The gold chrome was nice and shiny, but the figure itself was hard plastic and the legs and arms would never stay in position.

#### Chewbacca (Youth World)

Scored Chewbacca before I scored Han Solo because Chewbacca was/is very cool.

#### Han Solo (Cameo Stationery)

Remember spotting this figure at Cameo right under the checkout counter and gasped a bit. Youth World didn’t have it, but this place did.

#### Princess Leia Organa (Cameo)

Kinda forced myself to buy this one since Princess Leia is a girl and I wasn’t.

#### Darth Vader (Cameo Stationery)

Holy grail figure. Youth World never had it. Scored it on a trip to Cameo one day with my dad. Wa so stunned I got it I walked home basically just staring at the package for 6 blocks. Had to stop to show other kids what I scored.

#### Stormtrooper (Youth World)

Had two of these figures, but the second one was hard to find. I asked the older owner of Youth World to hold onto it for me but his son insisted there were no holds; the old guy would have held it for me. Happily came back later in the week when I had my allowance to buy it.

#### Death Squad Commander (Youth World)

Bought this one when it was one of the last ones I needed to complete my collection.

#### Jawa (Some Toy Store on 181st Street)

These were some of the hardest figures to get. When my brother heard I wanted these, he bought them from a toy store in Washington Heights. I liked them but really wanted to check out this other toy store myself; my brother insisted I should “not worry” and just let him buy figures for me if I wanted any more. I pushed harder and he relented to show me the store. They had tons of stuff, but my brother was constantly grumbling about why I would want to check out the toys myself. The idea of letting a kid explore/collect on their own was a foreign idea to him.

## 1978

#### R5-D4 (Cameo Stationery)

Really excited to get an R5-D4 figure since that droid looked cool despite having a bad motivator. But the back of the card revealed all kinds of oddball characters nobody really cared about on it back of it. It was clear to me they were milking the line for what it was worth.

#### Luke Skywalker X-Wing Pilot (Youth World)

While I was hesitant to accept this new “expansion” line of figures, but Luke Skywalker in an X-Wing pilot outfit looked better in an X-Wing cockpit. But it was still a stupid figure because now I had two Luke figures.

#### Walrus Man (Youth World)

I bought Walrus Man because the figure was going for like $1.79 or something and I had to fill my need to buy more *Star Wars* figures.

#### Hammerhead (Youth World)

Much like Walrus Man, I got Hammerhead for cheap and because I had an addiction. And it was Hammerhead.

#### Greedo (Youth World)

I had more mixed feelings about Greedo. Remember buying the figure at some point in the school year when we all had time off. Maybe before spring break or summer break. Ran into some kids from school on the street who said I should go to some after school gym class or something, but I didn’t trust the gym teachers there so I made some excuse to go home and open up Greedo.

#### Boba Fett (Mail Away Offer)

Awesome figure! First mail away figure that had a “mysterious” role in the next movie, *The Empire Strikes Back*. Had to save proof of purchase points from other figures I collected and send them in with a small shipping and handling fee to Kenner HQ and wait 6 weeks to get this figure in the mail in a small, white box. Such a cool thing! Except for the fact the missile firing backpack wasn’t going to fire a missile since Kenner—and other toy companies—neutered missile firing toys after some kid choked on one from a *Battlestar Galactica* toy.

#### Power Droid (Youth World)

One of the last figures I bought from the first *Star Wars* line. The Power Droid was cool, but goofy. I think I paid like $1.59 for that figure. The cardback was beat to hell, but hey… A bargain is a bargain.
