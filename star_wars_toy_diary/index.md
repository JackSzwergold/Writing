# Star Wars Toy Diary

This section is a placeholder for memories connected to collection *Star Wars* action figures back in the 1970s. At this point, it’s here mainly to motivate me to actually sit down and write about them already.

***

## 1977/1978

The original 12 *Star Wars* figures were a big deal to me—and other kids—and collecting them was an achievable goal.

#### [Luke Skywalker](Luke%20Skywalker)

Very first figure I bought with a begged for advance from my allowance.

#### [Ben Kenobi](Ben%20Kenobi)

Bought from Youth World as well.

#### [Sand People](Sand%20People)

Got two of these since hey… There are more than one of these nameless characters in the film.

#### [Artoo-Detoo](Artoo-Detoo)

Really liked this figure since it was small, made clicking noises and was easy to carry in my pocket.

#### [See-Threepio](See-Threepio)

Bought this figure and had mixed feelings about it: The gold chrome was nice and shiny, but the figure itself was hard plastic and the legs and arms would never stay in position.

#### [Chewbacca](Chewbacca)

Scored Chewbacca before I scored Han Solo because Chewbacca was/is very cool.

#### [Han Solo](Han%20Solo)

Remember spotting this figure at Cameo right under the checkout counter and gasped a bit.

#### [Princess Leia Organa](Princess%20Leia%20Organa)

Kinda forced myself to buy this one since Princess Leia is a girl and I wasn’t.

#### [Darth Vader](Darth%20Vader)

Holy grail figure. Scored it on a trip to Cameo one day with my dad.

#### [Stormtrooper](Stormtrooper)

Had two of these figures, but the second one was hard to find.

#### [Death Squad Commander](Death%20Squad%20Commander)

Bought this one when it was one of the last ones I needed to complete my collection.

#### [Jawa](Jawa)

Jawas were some of the hardest figures to get.

## 1978

With the exception of the mail-away offer Boba Fett, the rest of these figures seem to have been spit out by Kenner to cash in on the *Star Wars* craze that was sweeping the world at that time. And of course I had to buy these figures as well to complete my collection.

#### [R5-D4](R5-D4)

Really excited to get an R5-D4 figure since that droid looked cool despite having a bad motivator.

#### [Luke Skywalker X-Wing Pilot](Luke%20Skywalker%20X-Wing%20Pilot)

Luke Skywalker in an X-Wing pilot outfit looked better in an X-Wing cockpit than the first figure the made of him.

#### [Walrus Man](Walrus%20Man)

I bought Walrus Man because I had to fill my need to buy more *Star Wars* figures.

#### [Hammerhead](Hammerhead)

Much like Walrus Man, I got Hammerhead for cheap and because I had an addiction. And it was Hammerhead.

#### [Greedo](Greedo)

I had more mixed feelings about Greedo.

#### [Power Droid](Power%20Droid)

Power Droid (aka: Gonk) was one of the last figures I bought from the first *Star Wars* line.
 
#### [Boba Fett](Boba%20Fett)

Awesome figure! First mail away figure that had a “mysterious” role in the next movie, *The Empire Strikes Back*.

## 1980/1981

When *The Empire Strikes Back* came out, of course a whole new line of figures came out. And while I bought a few of them, I was outgrowing them and just didn’t have the strength or energy to buy them all. But I did buy some of them.

#### [Luke Skywalker Bespin Fatigues](Luke%20Skywalker%20Bespin%20Fatigues)

This Luke Skywalker figure was actually cooler than the other two Luke figures that were released.

#### [Han Solo Bespin Outfit](Han%20Solo%20Bespin%20Outfit)

Han Solo in Bespin gear was basically like Han Solo from the first line of toys; but this figure had brown pants.

#### [Lando Calrissian](Lando%20Calrissian)

Lando was pretty cool. First major black character in a *Star Wars* film.

#### [Yoda](Yoda)

When I felt I outgrew the *Star Wars* toys, I still kept Yoda on my desk.

#### [Imperial Stormtrooper Hoth Battle Gear](Imperial%20Stormtrooper%20Hoth%20Battle%20Gear)

Like the original Stormtroopers from the first film, I got two of these guys.

#### [Bossk](Bossk)

Right next to Yoda, I really liked this Bossk figure. The character looked cool and he carried a weird gun.

#### [Princess Leia Organa Hoth Outfit](Princess%20Leia%20Organa%20Hoth%20Outfit)

I bought this new Leia figure when I started to get bored with the toy line.

#### [Princess Leia Organa Bespin Gown](Princess%20Leia%20Organa%20Bespin%20Gown)

Ditto as above, I bought this new Leia figure when I started to get bored with the toy line.

#### [Han Solo Hoth Outfit](Han%20Solo%20Hoth%20Outfit)

One of the worst figures ever.

#### [Rebel Commander](Rebel%20Commander)

If I had a Han Solo figure bundled up for winter combat, might as well have had a commander figure as well.

#### [Rebel Soldier Hoth Battle Gear](Rebel%20Soldier%20Hoth%20Battle%20Gear)

There were no Rebel soldier figures in the original *Star Wars* line so I guess I had to buy this one.

#### [AT-AT Driver](AT-AT%20Driver)

I remember buying this figure and then—literally—not caring about buying *Star Wars* figures anymore. I was done.
