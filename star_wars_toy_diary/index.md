# Star Wars Toy Diary

This section is a placeholder for memories connected to collection *Star Wars* action figures back in the 1970s. At this point, it’s here mainly to motivate me to actually sit down and write about them already.

## 1977/1978

#### Luke Skywalker (Youth World)

Very first figure I bought with a begged for advance from my allowance.

#### Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi (Youth World)

Bought from Youth World as well.

#### Sand People (Youth World)

Got two of these since hey… There are more than one of these nameless characters in the film.

#### Artoo-Detoo (Youth World)

Really liked this figure since it was small, made clicking noises and was easy to carry in my pocket.

#### See-Threepio (Youth World)

Bought this figure and had mixed feelings about it: The gold chrome was nice and shiny, but the figure itself was hard plastic and the legs and arms would never stay in position.

#### Chewbacca (Youth World)

Scored Chewbacca before I scored Han Solo because Chewbacca was/is very cool.

#### Han Solo (Cameo Stationery)

Remember spotting this figure at Cameo right under the checkout counter and gasped a bit. Youth World didn’t have it, but this place did.

#### Princess Leia Organa (Cameo)

Kinda forced myself to buy this one since Princess Leia is a girl and I wasn’t.

#### Darth Vader (Cameo Stationery)

Holy grail figure. Youth World never had it. Scored it on a trip to Cameo one day with my dad. Wa so stunned I got it I walked home basically just staring at the package for 6 blocks. Had to stop to show other kids what I scored.

#### Stormtrooper (Youth World)

Had two of these figures, but the second one was hard to find. I asked the older owner of Youth World to hold onto it for me but his son insisted there were no holds; the old guy would have held it for me. Happily came back later in the week when I had my allowance to buy it.

#### Death Squad Commander (Youth World)

Bought this one when it was one of the last ones I needed to complete my collection.

#### Jawa (Some Toy Store on 181st Street)

These were some of the hardest figures to get. When my brother heard I wanted these, he bought them from a toy store in Washington Heights. I liked them but really wanted to check out this other toy store myself; my brother insisted I should “not worry” and just let him buy figures for me if I wanted any more. I pushed harder and he relented to show me the store. They had tons of stuff, but my brother was constantly grumbling about why I would want to check out the toys myself. The idea of letting a kid explore/collect on their own was a foreign idea to him.

## 1978

#### R5-D4 (Cameo Stationery)

Really excited to get an R5-D4 figure since that droid looked cool despite having a bad motivator. But the back of the card revealed all kinds of oddball characters nobody really cared about on it back of it. It was clear to me they were milking the line for what it was worth.
