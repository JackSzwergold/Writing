## Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi
### Purchased at Youth World on Brighton Beach Avenue

By Jack Szwergold

I remember buying the Ben (Obi-Wan) Menobi figure and feeling a bit conflicted. Not too sure I wanted a doll of an old man, but then again if I didn’t get him who would fight Darth Vader? Luke? Hah!

Anyway, I remeber buying him and feeling odd about how monk-like the figure looked. The folds of his robe and the way his legs were chunky because of that felt weird. But one thing I did like about this figure is how it smelled: Smelled just like fresh vinyl! And the tunic paint on his chest was a nice matte black.

His robe was a bit of a concern so I took it off whenever I could. It always seemed to me I would tear his robe moving his arm as I played with him. The robe itself came off pretty easilly and could be tossed to the side—or in the storage compartment of the Land Speeder toy—when I played with him.

That said, putting Ben Kenobi in the Land Speeder right next to Luke with R2-D2 and C-3P0 hitching a ride on the back was a fun, simple and achievable goal. So at the end of the day, scoring Ben Kenobi was worth the effort.
