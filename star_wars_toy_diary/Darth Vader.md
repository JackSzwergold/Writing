## Darth Vader
### Purchased at Cameo Stationery on Brighton Beach Avenue

By Jack Szwergold

Tracking down a Darth Vader figure in deep Brooklyn was nearly impossible. No idea if this had to do with the figure being popular or Kenner running low on supply or something else. But the only think I knew as a kid is I could never find this figure in Youth World.

I knew Cameo Stationery—which was deeper on Brighton Beach Avenue near Brighton 6th Street—carried some *Star Wars* figures, but they never seemed to have a great selection of stuff. Still I would stop in every now and then to see if they had some figure I wanted/needed.

One day while going shopping with my dad at the produce stands on the far end of Brighton Beach Avenue I decided to give Cameo another shot. My dad simply wanted to head back home with his shopping, but I was insistent about going in this time. And boy was it worth it!

I remember heading into the store and making a beeline for the cash register counter where they hung *Star Wars* figures on a small among of pegs. Pulled back a few Han Solos, Sand People and an R2-D2 or two and then suddenly I gasped… There it was! Darth Vader!

I carefully took it off of the peg and paid for it with all the money I had in my pocket at the time; which was about $2 dollars and change. The clerk in the store took the figure, placed it in a simple brown paper bag and I headed outside to show my dad.

“Look!” I said to him as I pulled the unopened Darth Vader figure out of the paper bag just enough to show him. “Very good!” he said, “That’s the main bad guy, right?” I nodded yes and we walked down Brighton Beach Avenue back home.

But this time I was walking extra slowly with the Darth Vader figure half-way out of the bag; just staring at it in awe all the way home. I was walking slow enough that a few neighborhood kids stopped to check out what I had and I was happy to show them. “Wow!” One of the kids said as I showed him the figure. “Why don’t you take it out?” Another kid asked and I replied, “No. I want to open it up at home.”

And when we got home I did open it up as carefully as I could. Of course I tore some of the card-back when I removed the bubble, but the figure itself came out nice and cleanly. And wow, did that new plastic toy smell really hit me hard! Unlike Ben Kenobi, I kept the cape on Darth Vader since he looked stupid without one. But as the days, weeks and months went on it was easy enough for me to repair any small tears with some black electrical tape my dad had. And heck, now that I had Darth Vader having Ben Kenobi made more sense; I finally had an enemy for my old man hero figure to fight.
