## Bossk (Youth World)
### Purchased at Youth World on Brighton Beach Avenue

Bossk pretty much had no role in *The Empire Strikes Back* but of all of the bounty hunters Darth Vader assembled on his Star Destroyer to hunt down Han Solo, Bossk was the cutest.

Bossk was this human sized lizard alien wearing a weird space suit that was a few sizes too small but still looked menancing on the big screen. But as a small 3.75‚Äù action figure, Bossk was just a cute little lizard with a weird gun. That was 

Right next to Yoda, I really liked this Bossk figure. The character looked cool and he carried a weird gun and even when I stopped collecting *Star Wars* figures,  Bossk was always one of my favorites.
