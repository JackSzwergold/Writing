## Han Solo Bespin Outfit
### Variety Store on King’s Highway Near the Train Station

By Jack Szwergold

I started to scope out new and different stores outside of Brighton Beach in my quest to find cool new toys. The *Variety Store* on King’s Highway was one of them. One block away from the King’s Highway stop on the D line and they had tons of stuff. Han Solo in Bespin gear was basically like Han Solo from the first line of toys; but this figure had brown pants.
