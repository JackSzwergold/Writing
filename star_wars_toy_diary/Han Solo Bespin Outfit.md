## Han Solo Bespin Outfit
### Variety Store on King’s Highway Near the Train Station

By Jack Szwergold

Han Solo in his “Bespin Outfit” was basically the same figure as his figure in the first film. Except this figure has him wearing brown pants and a blue jacket.

Still, this figure looks cool. The colors were cool and the trim on his legs was cool. Much more fun to play with than that stupid Han Solo in a “Hoth Outfit” figure I scored.
