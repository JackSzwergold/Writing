## Death Squad Commander
### Purchased at Youth World on Brighton Beach Avenue

By Jack Szwergold

Man, did I hate this figure. The only thing cool about it was his name: “Death Squad Commander.” A name like that really reinforced the idea that the Empire was modeled after the Nazis in World War II, so it felt like there was some cool connection between this specific figure and my own family’s Holocaust background.

But that said, this figure was stupid. The picture of the guy on the card-back was pretty old, but the face on the figure was pretty young. Also the helmet was stupid and covered his head like some weird mushroom. And past that, why a figure of some miscellaneous military commander who was fairly low ranked instead of—let’s say—a figure of someone like Grand Moff Tarkin?

Anyway, I dutifully bought this figure to complete my set of the original 12 figures but had utterly no idea how to integrate him into my *Star Wars* figures adventures so he mostly just stayed on his peg on the display stand. At least buying him helped me score another proof of purchase seal to add to my small bank of seals I could use to get free stuff at some point.
