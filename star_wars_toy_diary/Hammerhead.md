## Hammerhead
### Purchased at Youth World on Brighton Beach Avenue

By Jack Szwergold

Another scrub figure from the 1978 “Let’s cash in on the kids buying the first 12 figures!” wave of eight extra figures.

It was kind of cool they made this figure, but at the same time this character was barely existent in the film. I mean Walrus Man was a drunken bully to Luke Skywalker in the Mos Eisley Cantina and Greedo threatened Han Solo’s life, but Hammerhead? What exactly did he do? Just sit in a corner and drink some beverage of some sort? He did nothing and they gave him a figure for the effort.

The figure itself kinda sucked. His head was nice and oddball, but past that the figure was lazy in design: His whole torso was some blue onesie and his legs and arms seemed like tree limbs. He was the kind of figure that seemed to need a robe or a cape, but never came with one. He did come with a blaster rifle which was cool, but then again if you were a kid and had this figure, who would he be shooting and why?
