## Han Solo Hoth Outfit
### Purchased at Youth World on Brighton Beach Avenue

By Jack Szwergold

What a piece of crap this figure was and is. It’s supposedly Han Solo all bundled up for the snow, but he’s barely recognizable. It just looks like some guy bundled up for the snow.

No idea why I ever wanted to get this one, but I got it okay. I think I went and bought this figure after some crappy day and needed some “shopping therapy” before I even know what that phrase meant.

I might have also bought this figure since Han Solo wears this outfit in my dad’s the scene in the film. The one where cuts open a Tauntaun to shove Luke into so he could keep warm in the cold.

But whatever the reason was, I hated—and still hate—this specific figure. Such a bad variant.
