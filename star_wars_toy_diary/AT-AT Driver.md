## AT-AT Driver (Variety Store on King’s Highway Near the Train Station)

By Jack Szwergold

I didn’t own a full sized AT-AT play-set, but wanted to get this figure mainly for the design quality. Honestly the paint job on this, slightly better quality plastic cool rifle hooked me. But I remember buying this figure and then—literally—not caring about buying *Star Wars* figures anymore. I was done.
