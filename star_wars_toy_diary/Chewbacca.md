## Chewbacca
### Purchased at Youth World on Brighton Beach Avenue

By Jack Szwergold

Who doesn’t like Chewbacca! And I scored this figure before finding Han Solo because Chewbacca is just so cool. And the figure itself was really cool.

While Chewbacca’s head didn’t move, the carving in the plastic looked really cool. It was years later when I learned that the molds for these figures were based on wood carvings and no figure better shows off that aspect of the design than Chewbacca.

Chewbacca also had a cool bowcaster rifle that was cool. Although it didn’t really look like the crossbow he had in the film, it was still a nice new type of gun for the Kenner action figure line instead of the endless piles of blasters and Stormtrooper rifles every figure seemed to come with.

The only thing about Chewbacca that irked me a bit was the fact his legs were uneven so he never was able to stand right. Maybe my particular figure had oddly molded legs, but whatever. Still liked the figure and was happy to display it when I could as a kid.
