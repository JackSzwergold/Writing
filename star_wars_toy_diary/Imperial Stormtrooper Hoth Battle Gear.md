## Imperial Stormtrooper Hoth Battle Gear
### Purchased at Youth World on Brighton Beach Avenue

By Jack Szwergold

With each new *Star Wars* film comes a new type of stormtrooper. For *The Empire Strikes Back*, we get the Imperial Stormtrooper in Hoth battle gear.

I liked the fact this stormtrooper had a huge new rifle-type of gun. But past that the fact this stormtrooper had some vinyl snow skirt—ish cape to protect him. It just seemed superfluous. But if you took it off, the figure looked stupid. So I didn’t really play with this figure much.

That said, since it was a stormtrooper, I had a need to get another figure so I could have a two troop “squad” of stormtroopers like I did with the ones from the first movie.
