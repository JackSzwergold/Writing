## Artoo-Detoo
### Purchased at Youth World on Brighton Beach Avenue

The nice thing about the original Kenner line of *Star Wars* toys is they were actual toys. Nothing really exemplified that better—in my mind—than the small R2-D2 figure they released.

I was into the *Micronauts* at the time and R2-D2 seemed to fit right into that non-related toy line: A robot, simple design, click-sound for a gimmick and a chrome head. But unlike the *Micronauts*, R2-D2 was far more durable and toy-like.

I could carry R2-D2 wherever I wanted to: School, the park, the beach, some bullshit family event… Anywhere I needed a quick and simple distraction from the adult world.

That said, one annoying thing about R2-D2 was the sticker they used for the torso of his body. It wore out pretty quickly from basic handling. But that’s a minor complaint because when I had R2-D2 I bought the figure as a toy; not some crazy collector’s item.
