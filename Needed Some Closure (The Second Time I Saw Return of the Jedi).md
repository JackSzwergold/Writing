# Needed Some Closure (The Second Time I Saw Return of the Jedi)

By Jack Szwergold, June 17, 2015

Back in the day you had to drag your ass to an actual theater to see a movie again. In those days before VCRs and cable TV were commonplace there simply wasn’t any other choice for most people if you enjoyed a film and wanted to take in the experience again.

I mean, going to a theater to see a movie again wasn’t a completely new idea to me or anyone else. Personally, I sat through two back-to-back screenings of *The Muppet Movie* and *Superman II* in the same day, in the same theater, because I liked each of those films that much. And when *The Empire Strikes Back* was re-released in theaters in 1981—after it’s initial 1980 release—I was quite happy to pay full-price to be able see it again.

But with *Return of the Jedi* I went to see it again a week later in the same exact theater not because I liked it the first time I saw it. Not at all; in fact I hated it. But rather because I simply had no idea *why* I hated it so much. And I needed some closure to the issue.

The deal was I invested a lot of my young life into giving a shit about *Star Wars*. And while I didn’t own every single piece of *Star Wars* memorabilia or toys—or even go to conventions—I did own a lot of *Star Wars* related stuff. Like piles of *Star Wars* Topps trading cards, Kenner action figures and Marvel comics. And I scoured the local used bookstore’s used comics bin for pretty much any ragged copy of the *Star Wars* comic I could find. I mean I never even read those crappy comics, but I at least needed to purchase and possess something with the *Star Wars* logo/name on it to sate my desire for new stuff in between films, right? Heck, I even special ordered Alan Dean Foster’s 1978 *Splinter of the Mind’s Eye* novel just so I could get a brand new copy; not a ragged used copy or a reject copy with the cover ripped off.

Anyway, when I overheard two other junior high school friends of mine—who didn’t see the film on it’s opening weekend—making plans to see it the following weekend, I asked to join them. “But you already saw it, right?” one of them said. “Yeah, but I want to see it again.” And with that said and done, I was all set to see *Return of the Jedi* one more time.

We showed up at the Kingsway on Saturday morning. It was the same theater I saw it in the first time a week earlier. But unlike the first time, there was a line. A fairly huge line. “Shit!” I said as we tried to find where the end of the line snaked to. Luckily it wasn’t too far back and ended just around the corner of Kings Highway and East 10th Street. “Okay, here we are,” I said. “And now what?” a friend said. “Well, we wait.” And so we waited.

I had brought along my copy of the official Marvel comics movie program for *Return of the Jedi* so I flipped through it while we waited in line. I was trying to squeeze blood out of a stone it seems because I pored over the program before I saw *Return of the Jedi* for the first time and even after I saw it. And now I was poring over it while I waited in line to see a movie that would be screening before my eyes in the next 30 to 45 minutes out of boredom and the desperation to know why the film didn’t resonate with me the way the other two *Star Wars* films did.

“Jack!” a friend said. “We’re going to Crazy Eddie to check out records. We’ll be back.” “Okay, but don’t take too long,” I responded. And with that I was holding our collective places in line.

“Hey, can I see that?” said some guy behind me. He was a lot taller than me and seemed nice enough so I obliged. He started to flip through the program and would occasionally quip about this, that or the other to his girlfriend. She was bored as hell but then lit up the second she saw a picture of an Ewok in the program. “What is that?” she said with a thick, Bensonhurst Brooklyn accent. Me and he boyfriend both responded, “Ewok…” at the same time. “How did you know that?” the guy said. “Well, what else would it be?” And we both shrugged.

Soon after that the line started to move, but my friends were nowhere in sight. I got a bit nervous so I twitchily asked the guy for my program back. “Wait a sec… Hang on…” he said, clearly being a dick about giving it back. So I persisted and soon he was glowering at me and handed back the program all rolled up. “Thanks!” I said to him as I nervously started to unroll and flatten the program out again just as my friends came back.

“Hey! What did you get?” and they both showed me their modest haul. One of them bought a 45 single of *The Pretenders’* “Back on the Chain Gang” and the other bought a 45 single of *Culture Club’* “Time.” And I shrugged and said, “Okay…” as we all moved forward in line to the the ticket office window.

Within a few minutes we were all in the same exact balcony theater in pretty much the same exact area I saw it the first time; near the left, center side. And that wasn’t the only thing that was the same: Just like the first time, the crowd was noisy and the theater was filled with kids who were just too young to be in the theater to begin with.

Past any of that theater experience stuff, my feelings about each scene in the film itself were pretty much the same; nothing resonated at best or came off as hokey at worse. The only real difference this time around is I noticed some sloppy special effects moments. Like when Han Solo and Lando Calrissian were standing in a hangar talking about the Millennium Falcon; that very specific shot looked really stiff, badly composed and the matte painting background of the hangar stood out like a sore thumb. And I did notice that one bit where the two T.I.E. fighters seemed to appear out of nowhere during the final Death Star battle after that Admiral Ackbar lobster guy shouted “It’s a trap!” But past being able to nitpick those kind of aesthetic details, the film itself still fell flat for me.

When the film finally ended and the credits began to roll we all stood up to leave. Walking down the aisle one friend simply said, “Well, that wasn’t that good.” And nobody disagreed.

Once outside the theater, we all decided to take the B68 bus back to Brighton Beach since it was at the stop already and we knew it would be an air conditioned ride home on a hot spring day. We all got in, talked about the film and other stuff—like copying computer games—and then each got off at our respective stops.

As the bus got near my stop I stood up, rang the bell, said goodbye and hopped out the back door. It wasn’t too late so I grabbed a slice of pizza from Rocco’s walked around the corner and headed back home. My dad was sitting outside the building in a folding chair reading the newspaper with all of the other folks from the building who seemed to only sit in front of the building all day.

“So how was it?” he asked? I shrugged and said, “Ehhh…” while taking another bite of my slice and leaning back to sit on the small brick wall in front of the building. My dad saw the *Return of the Jedi* program under my arm and asked to look at it. I passed it over to him and he flipped through it, looked at my watch and then said I was going upstairs. He held onto the program for the rest of the afternoon as I headed upstairs to put on some music, play some computer games and then take a nap.
