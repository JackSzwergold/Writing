# Eating Spaghetti for Dinner with Health Nuts (The Young Boyfriend of the Old Hollywood Actress)

By Jack Szwergold, May 29, 2015

One day in the mid-1980s after high school let out, I headed to the deeper side of Brighton Beach; away from my family’s home on Ocean Parkway. I was very into playing, copying and trading Atari home computer games back then so I was going over to a friend’s house to hang out and copy some video games before the weekend hit.

While we’re sitting around, checking out games—and copying a few of them—his little brother comes by and says that his friend’s cousin was in the city today. This was kind of a big deal because his cousin was fairly infamous around the neighborhood for two things: Being extremely gay and being the supposed “boyfriend” of some famous, elderly Hollywood actress.

One of the weirdest things about Brighton Beach is how much it was connected to the wider world of pop culture and entertainment, but oftentimes the saddest, oddest and most pathetic parts of it. This guy was sad, odd, pathetic and creepy.

After an hour or so we found out my friend’s little brother had invited his friend and his creepy cousin to come by. I was stunned because I didn’t want to meet him or deal with him. I was looking at all of the games we were copying and hoping they would finish copying before he came over, but no such luck. Soon enough he was in the apartment and we were all going to sit down and have some kind of awkward dinner together.

Despite the fact my friend’s family were a bunch of obsessive health nuts who would lecture you to death on the benefits of this vitamin or that vitamin, absolutely nobody in that family knew how to cook to save their life. So the big meal at my friend’s house was either pizza, take out Chinese food or spaghetti. That night it was spaghetti. And I had the honor of sitting directly across the table from the creepy cousin while we all ate spaghetti.

The guy was tanned, a bit creepy and definitely gay. Now I’m saying “gay”—and sprinkling the word “creepy” in—so much I feel a bit uncomfortable about it. Don’t hate me because I genuinely respect anyone’s and everyone’s sexuality and personal beliefs. But the thing is this guy didn’t identify himself as gay to others despite the fact he was very, very, very obviously gay. I had honestly never seen or heard anyone so openly effeminate in my life before. It was like a younger, creepier, more tanned version of Rip Taylor was sitting across from me. But his gayness was no big deal to me at the time or even now.

What was a big deal was how creepy he was in everything he did and how he carried himself. If he wasn’t open about his own sexuality, it was quite open—and glib—about his relationship with that elderly Hollywood actress he was “dating.” He was in his late 30s and she was in her early 80s; that’s a pretty damned creepy age gap. And we all got to hear about it while eating cheap spaghetti with canned parmesan sprinkled over it and washing it all down with glasses of White Rose ginger ale.

“What do you think of the spaghetti, Jack? It tastes good, right?” the cousin said oddly while staring at me from across the table. The guy had the smile and eyes of a slick salesman and/or lunatic. I nodded and agreed that the food was good. And soon after that I practically inhaled the spaghetti off of my plate and excused myself from the table.

I went back to my friend’s room to check on the games that were being copied. Happily everything had finished copying and I packed up my stuff so I could go home.

As I walked to the door, everyone—including the creepy cousin—stood up to say goodbye to me. “Nice meeting you, Jack!” the cousin said just as I was heading out the door. The way he said it, I half expected him to be out in the hallway with me when the door closed. But happily everyone said their goodbyes, the door was closed and then it was only me standing in the hallyway.

Their apartment was on the top floor of the building so I hit the elevator button to go down. After a few seconds with no sign of the elevator coming, I turned around and ran down the stairs and out onto the street.

It was a nice, warm evening so I decided to walk along the boardwalk back to Ocean Parkway—instead of walking underneath the elevated subway on Brigton Beach Avenue—to take in some of the fresh air and sun before calling it a day.
