Some friends of mine from P.S. 253 had a vacation home in Vermont. This was weird and kinda entitled in the 1970s since most — if not all — of the people who lived in Brighton Beach were poor, working class and were lucky enough to live a few blocks away from the beach let alone own a second vacation home out of state.

The way I understood it is my friend’s parents both worked for the city — the mom was a social worker and the dad was a school guidance counselor — so they managed to know someone who knew someone who sold them a small vacation home in Vermont.

Anyway, sometime in 4th or 5th grade they invited me to visit them up in Vermont. It was a cool, kind and generous invitation extended to me and my city-kid life. But my parents were older and didn’t drive. Which meant it was up to my brother — who is 20 years older than me — to be my vacation partner.

Truth be told, my brother wasn’t manifesting himself as a complete jerk at that time. But this trip would slowly reveal shades of his nasty side I had not really seen yet.

The trip up to Vermont was actually fun. Never went on a significant road trip until then and even driving past Bear Mountain in upstate New York was it’s own thrill.

We got to stop at cool rest stops and I marveled at the wood paneling and orange seats; they looked like a very “good” and well maintained McDonald’s but more WASPy. Never saw so many pickup trucks in nice shape as well as vending machines that sold smoking monkeys and other silly novelties as well. But like every trip with my brother I could never actually purchase anything I liked without a headache inducing fight.

“Why do you want this garbage?” he asked as I started to put money in the machine to get a smoking monkey. “Because I like it,” I responded and as I was about to shove some quarters into the machine he would grab me and say “There’s no time. We have to go.” And without that I would be literally dragged kicking and screaming away from the machine to the front door of the rest stop. “We can buy better toys when we get back,” he said which triggered it’s own unique anxiety in me. Nothing was worse than having my brother and his stupid wife — who hated mainstream mass-marketed toys and had a Bank Street College degree to assert her biases against mainstream mass-marketed toys — drag me to an “educational” toy store.

But that was neither here nor there since — thankfully — my brother was forgetful of unwanted promises like that and after a decent trip to Vermont he would definitely forget it. And soon enough we would be back on the road and headed up to Vermont.

When we got to my friend’s place it was cool and comfortable. It was a humble little house; not exactly a shack, but not exactly a mansion either. Just a basic and rustic little two story structure and near a stream.

We spent days doing tons of useful nothing things like exploring the woods or rummaging through a small junkyard filled with old glass and rusty metal stuff. There was even the rusted out shell of a car sitting nearby. It was covered with weeds and vines, but still had seat springs and a steering wheel in place.

Unfortunately we couldn’t get that rusty car out of the junkyard to bring it back to the cabin, so we had to do other things to bide our lazy summer childhood time during the summer. Like going fishing.

Much like a lot of my city childhood memories, fishing wasn’t anything city kids really did. When it came to fishing, I mainly saw middle-aged to older guys either fishing on the rocks of beach in Brighton Beach or fishing off of the pier near the parachute jump in Coney Island. The only time I ever saw kids fishing were in TV shows like “The Andy Griffith Show” or old Little Rascals reruns and stuff like that.

So this whole “gone fishing” thing was a learning experience for me.

First — and most importantly — this was a “no adults” outing. Which was great! We simply — and pretty impulsively — grabbed some fishing poles from the closet, grabbed a pocket knife, and headed down the country road near us to the nearby lake.

We passed by some fields with old fashioned stake and wire fences and cows behind them. Don’t know if they were working farms, but the cows were cool. After a while — just about when the walk was getting boring, tedious and tiresome — we arrived in town.

This “town” consisted of a strip of maybe six to seven buildings at most. Only a few of them were shops of any kind. I mainly remember a gas station, general store and maybe a junk store of some kind mixed in there. Even as a kid I knew this town was clearly fading away, if it ever shone at all. But was not a complete tourist trap or discarded memory yet so it was a comfortable sort of limbo to meander around.

We walked into the general store and asked about worms. The guy behind the counter pointed to the cooler case in front of the register. Asking about worms was weird enough, but it blew my city kid’s mind when I peered into to cooler case: Right there — next to the ice cream and cups of ice — were small styrofoam cups filled with dirt and worms. The cups were covered in some kind of plastic wrap (with air holes punched) and that was held in place with a rubber band. Nothing fancy; just cups of cooler chilled worms up for sale.

We opened up the cooler, randomly picked a cup of worms, paid he guy for the works and just walked over to the lake.

It was a bright and sunny day; not too warm and not too hot with just enough of a breeze to cool you off every now and the. We sat down near the paved edge of the lake, opened up the cup of worms and grabbed one lucky worm who had the honor to be the first worm to be used as fishing bait.

“You do it,” my friend said when it came time to put one on the hook. “What?” I responded, “I never did that before.”

So I grabbed the hook on my pole’s line, grabbed a worm and looked at it. “Now what?” I said and shrugged as he told me I had to poke the worm through the hook. “Really?” I said and “Yes!” he responded. I looked at the dirt covered slimy worm in my right hand and hook in my left hand and paused. Just as I was about to pierce the worm through the hook my friend stopped me and said, “Wait! We should cut it in half.”

His reasoning was we were two people fishing and the cup only had so many worms. So if we cut them in half we’d have twice as many worms.

So with that he pulled out his pocket knife and I put the worm down on the cement.

It writhed around a bit and I said, “Okay, cut him.” But my friend chickened out and handed me the knife. “You do it,” he said. And I guess that became my job for the day.

I looked at the knife and — like all kids pocket knives — the blade was kinda shiny but still looked dull; I guess pocket knife manufacturers didn’t want kids stabbing each other. That said, in took the knife in my hand, held onto the worm, pressed that dull knife as hard as I could onto it, and sliced it in half. “Ewww,” my friend said as I took a squirming half of the worm in my hand and poked it through the hook. With that I stood up, positioned the pole behind me and flung the weighted hook into the lake.

My line landed in the lake, and the floater bobbed a bit as it settled. My friend did the same thing with the other half of the worm and his pole.

Soon enough both of our lines were in the water and we both just sat and waited for the floaters to twitch a bit indicating that a fish bit the hook and we caught one.

I held onto my pole for a bit and then just let it sit on the edge of the lake as we waited.

I stood up and looked into the water. It wasn’t exactly clear or murky; just cloudy and a bit brackish. You could see various shapes move back and forth, but never enough to know what you were looking at. At some point something breached the water to grab a fly or something it saw on the surface: It was a catfish.

“Are we going to just catch a catfish?” I asked and my friend just shrugged. I mean catfish are cool, but they are no grand prize. Soon his line was twitching. He grabbed his pole, stood up and started to pull it in; I crouched near the edge of the lake waiting to see what he’d pull in. After a few minutes of reeling and pulling I could see it: It was a big, brown, greasy catfish.

I grabbed the line and pulled it up onto the shore. It twitched and gasped for air as it laid on the concrete slab near the edge of the lake.

“Ugh. I don’t want it,” my friend said. “Pull the hook out and toss it back,” he added. And with that, I carefully grabbed the catfish, making sure not to get my hands too close to the sharp quills around it’s head, and pulled the hook out and tossed it back in the lake. I watched as it flopped a bit in the water and then made a beeline away from us.

My hands were all slimed up from handling the catfish, so I wiped them on my jeans and before I knew it, my line was twitching. I went to grab the pole and managed to grab it just before the whole thing fell in lake.

“Whoa!” I said as I pulled the pole up and started to reel it in. Whatever it was it flapped a bit and breached the water in the distance. We both could see it was not a catfish; it was some kind of “normal” fish.

I pulled it in some more and then reeled it up out of the water: It was a rainbow trout! We we both kind of stunned; this was my first time fishing and my first catch and it was something genuinely cool.

“That’s amazing!” My friend said as I put it on the hot concrete at the edge of the lake, removed the hook and held it in my hand. It was slimy and “fishy” like a fish should be, but it had scales so I could get a better grip on it.

My friend found a paper bag nearby, and I tossed the flopping fish inside of it.

“Let’s go home,” I said and with that we packed up our gear and headed back to his family’s summer home.

When we got back I showed off my catch. Everyone was impressed. I walked over to the kitchen sink to wash it off and someone suggested we eat it. I shouted, “No!” as I laid it down on the counter near the sink.

That said, I looked at it on the counter and wondered what to do with it. My friend’s dad said he would wrap it in plastic and put it in the fridge which made sense to me so that’s what we did and we called it a night.

The next day it was time for me and my brother to head home to Brooklyn.

So we got all of our stuff, brought it downstairs and started to pack it into his car when I remembered the fish. I ran into the house and my brother sniped at me “Don’t worry! It’s no big deal!” I ignored his passive aggressive shouts, headed to the refrigerator and pulled out the plastic wrapped rainbow trout.

As I held the fish and headed outside, I realized how hot it was outside and how cool the fish felt as I held onto it.

“How can we keep it cool on the ride back?” I said as I walked to my brother. My friend’s dad said, “Don’t worry, I’ll get some ice,” and before he could even turn around to head into the house, my brother shouts, “No!!!” Everyone stopped to look at him and wondered what he meant. I mean ice is ice and ice can keep things cool, so what’s the big deal? I tentatively asked, “So how are we going to keep the fish fresh?” to which my brother mumbled a bit and pulled some aluminum foil out of the trunk of his car, walked over to me and said, “Give me the fish!” Feeling so bit unsure, but not knowing what else to do, I handed him the fish.

He proceeded to wrap it in aluminum foil, then put it in a towel and unceremoniously plop it in the trunk of the car.

“No!” I screamed. “What about the ice?” I added. “Don’t worry,” he said. “It would all be fine,” he added. But I was still concerned. Even my friend’s dad asked, “You sure you don’t want any ice?” To which my brother shouted, “No!” And then looked at me and said, “Let’s go.” And with that I said my goodbyes to my friend and their family, got into the car and headed home.

On the drive home I occasionally asked about the fish and my brother would dismiss my concerns even when we stopped at rest stops and I felt hot surface of the outside of the trunk with my hand. It was clearly hot on the outside, so it had to be hot on the inside, right? But maybe my brother knew something I didn’t know.

After a few hours of driving we were back in Brooklyn.

My brother drove down the service road and parked the car close to our family’s building on Ocean Parkway. It was a nice and sunny day and I could see my mom and dad sitting outside the building. They waved at us and I waved back. I was happy to see them.

My dad walked over to the car just as we were getting out. “Did you have a good time?” he asked as I ran over to hug him and I said, “Yes!” I enthusiastically told him about the fish I caught. “Really?” he said, and I said “Yes!” again as I ran to the trunk of the car to get it and show it to him.

As my brother opened it up on that hot summer day, the stench of rotting fish soaked the air. “No!!!” I screamed, “It’s rotted!!!” I added as I grabbed the towel wrapped fish and started to unwrap it. With towel off the smell just got stronger and as I looked through the plastic wrap, it just looked as disgusting as it smelled; it wasn’t a cool catch of a fish anymore but just a piece of rancid, rotten garbage. A corpse of a fish you would bury in the ground as fertilizer.

I stood there and started to cry, “Why didn’t you take the ice?!?” and my brother just dismissively responded, “It’s no big deal.” My dad put his hand on my shoulder, squeezed and started yelling at my brother in Polish, Hebrew and maybe Yiddish. No idea what language it was but it was one of those fights they had in front of me in another language as if that would protect me. As if humans barking in words that I didn’t understand would somehow spare me the trauma of the fight happening to begin with.

Soon, my dad and brother stopped fighting and I walked with my dad back to our building. As we walked the short distance, I held onto that disgusting pile of heat rotted fish as if it were gold. Just as we go to the front door, my dad said we should throw it out. I resisted the idea initially but with my brother still tending to his car behind us and my dad next to me it seemed to make sense: The fish was in nasty shape to say the least and if we brought it inside of the apartment it would stink up the place. The catch was a fond memory and this rotting fish was just a painful corpse of nostalgia at this point.

So with that we walked to the building’s garbage cans, opened one of them up and tossed it in.

We walked back to the front of the building, and my brother was there to say goodbye. He bent down near me and asked, “So you had fun?” and I nodded politely; not only did he not take ownership for the fish rotting into garbage, he was not willing to mention how by doing so he ruined my first fishing catch of my life. Remember, this is the behavior of someone who is 20 years older than me.

He gently tapped me with a “We’re cool, right?” tap on my shoulder, stood up and said goodbye to my dad and headed back to his car to head back to his home in Washington Heights.

I was happy to see him drive off; the tension of his presence slipped away as the car sped off in the distance.

I went upstairs to put my all my stuff back and then headed outside to play a bit with neighborhood kids. I told them about the fish I caught, but with nothing to show it was just at story at that point.
