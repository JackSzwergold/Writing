            <p name="9ff4" id="9ff4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Danny was a high school friend of a friend from Midwood. He lived on East 15th Street near Avenue J. He lived in Midwood and went to Midwood High School. I lived in Brighton
              Beach and went to Abraham Lincoln High School. We got along because we were weirdos and had a mutual friend; a connector if you will.</p>
            <p name="a45f" id="a45f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anyway, Danny was a friend and one day we headed up to the Met Museum. I think we somehow both had school projects that involved the museum. I barely recall what mine was, but I
              know we wandered and took notes.</p>
            <p name="c0d7" id="c0d7" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Pretty cool, huh?” he said as we passed by some sculptures. “Yeah, I guess,” I said. To be honest, I tolerated the trip to the museum more than I
              enjoyed it. The emotional scarring of being dragged to the Met as a kid less than 10 years prior was still burned in my head. “All this stuff is boring,” was my defense mechanism at the time.</p>
            <p name="0aef" id="0aef" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Boring?” Danny said. “What is boring about this?” He said effortlessly waving his hand around.</p>
            <p name="0044" id="0044" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing">“I dunno,” I said as I skulked around.</p>

            <p name="e8fb" id="e8fb" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">After a short while we left. As I walked out the doors and stepped down onto the stairs of the museum, I felt the afternoon sun, air and sky and — most of all — I felt free.</p>
            <p name="1eb4" id="1eb4" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Let’s get out of here,” I said.</p>
            <p name="1d21" id="1d21" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Why? Let’s hang out,” he responded.</p>
            <p name="5cbe" id="5cbe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As I looked around at the throngs of tourists, hot dog carts and general tourist hell I said, “Why? Let’s just go to the Village if you want to hang out.”</p>
            <p name="a843" id="a843" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Fine,” he responded. And with that we both walked down towards the Lexington Avenue subway.</p>
            <p name="05fa" id="05fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As we headed down whatever street in the 80s on the Upper East Side we were on, we passed some small bakery. The window was filled with tarts of some kind. They all seemed pretty
              expensive for a high school kid with little to no disposable income.</p>
            <p name="1ef3" id="1ef3" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I want them!” Danny said. “Whose going to pay for them?” I asked. “Let me see how much they cost,” he said as he headed inside. I stood outside and
              waited.</p>
            <p name="28ba" id="28ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After a while he came out and said, “They’re like $4 to $5 a piece.” He said as we continued walking. “That’s more than a slice of pizza and a soda,” I said. I mean it was the
              1980s and the cost to ride a subway was $1 and a soda was around ¢45 to ¢50 at the time.</p>
            <p name="4a00" id="4a00" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Come on! Let’s do it one day!” he said. “Do what?” I asked. “Get some tarts and just sit on the steps in front of the Met Museum. “And then what?” I
              asked. “Let’s just be cool and do that,” he said.</p>
            <p name="37cb" id="37cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With that we got on the subway.</p>
            <p name="cbbf" id="cbbf" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“So we would just sit there? There’s nobody our age or anything there. You just want to sit on the steps and be cool?” I said. “Yes! Exactly!” he
              said.</p>
            <p name="b74b" id="b74b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I just simply shrugged and say back in my seat and let that pass.</p>
            <p name="2435" id="2435" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">We decided to skip heading over to the Village and headed back home on the D train. Danny got off at Avenue J and I stayed on to head back to Ocean Parkway.</p>

            <p name="3da5" id="3da5" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">A few weeks pass and I get a call from Danny on a Saturday afternoon.</p>
            <p name="c0d9" id="c0d9" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“What’s up?” I ask. “Let’s do it!” he says. “Do what?” I ask. “Let’s go hang out at the Met!”</p>
            <p name="a177" id="a177" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I rolled my eyes, set a time and got the subway and met up with Danny at the Avenue J station.</p>
            <p name="73e5" id="73e5" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“This all seems like bullshit,” I said to which Danny replied, “Oh come on, how much money did you bring along?” he asked. I said I had about $12 or
              $13. “That’s all?” he said and I responded, “How many tarts are we going to eat exactly?” He nodded and we rode the subway, transferred at Atlantic Avenue and headed to the Upper East Side.</p>
            <p name="2ac1" id="2ac1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We got off the train and walked over to the small bakery and each bought a tart. I remember mine being something like cherry and lemon. Whatever, Danny and I had our blessed
              tarts and we were headed to the steps of the Met Museum.</p>
            <p name="6e38" id="6e38" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And after a few blocks, we finally reached our destination! The Met Museum steps itself.</p>
            <p name="b348" id="b348" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The sun was setting and the trees in Central Park were silhouetted as we approached. The place was either closing up or about to close up, but it meant nothing to us: We were
              just going to be “cool” and sit down on the steps in front of the Met Museum.</p>
            <p name="5768" id="5768" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So we did that.</p>
            <p name="3cd0" id="3cd0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I sat down and so did Danny. And within moments we were eating those stupid tarts.</p>
            <p name="08ef" id="08ef" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“What else happens?” I asked as I took a bite and turned to Danny.</p>
            <p name="eca5" id="eca5" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“This is it!” he said.</p>
            <p name="a579" id="a579" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And so we sat there and before you knew it was dark enough to see stars if you faced away from the sun.</p>
            <p name="4719" id="4719" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As we sat and ate our expensive fruit pies, a cleaning crew came out to clean up the front of the Met… Including the stairs.</p>
            <p name="a631" id="a631" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Should we leave?” I said as I crumbled up the paper bag in my hand.</p>
            <p name="24e1" id="24e1" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“No… Why?” Danny asked.</p>
            <p name="38de" id="38de" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Look…” I said waving my hand towards the cleaning crew.</p>
            <p name="6ff8" id="6ff8" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“So what?” he said so we sat there.</p>
            <p name="cbe1" id="cbe1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then some security guard came by and told us to move.</p>
            <p name="fa76" id="fa76" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Why?” Danny retorted.</p>
            <p name="2fec" id="2fec" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Because they have to clean up,“ the guard said. “Come on… Move along…”</p>
            <p name="4131" id="4131" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Danny got a bit tense… And then got dramatic… “Well okay then!” he blurted out at the guard.</p>
            <p name="9883" id="9883" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Me and the guard both were taken aback a bit but I stood up — and so did Danny — and we walked away.</p>
            <p name="ff8a" id="ff8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I tried to be as cordial to the guard as possible to try to keep things calm, but Danny looked like he was about to burst out of his own skin. Which was weird because I’m usually
              the tense one.</p>
            <p name="8271" id="8271" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As we both reached the bottom of the stairs, I waved back to the guard to make sure he knew we were cool. He waved back and nodded.</p>
            <p name="d446" id="d446" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When we reached the corner, I threw my crumbled up paper back in the trash. Danny followed suit but was a bit more aggressive in his trash dunking.</p>
            <p name="d098" id="d098" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You okay, Danny?” I asked him.</p>
            <p name="4c13" id="4c13" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I’m fine,” he skulked as we walked back to the train and made the trip back home.</p>
            <p name="fc4a" id="fc4a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The ride home was quiet but tense. Danny barely said a word.</p>
            <p name="9751" id="9751" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By the time we got to Avenue J, he stood up… I said, “Goodnight!”</p>
            <p name="6cf3" id="6cf3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He grumbled a meet “Goodnight…” in response and headed out the door and down the stairs.</p>
            <p name="bf09" id="bf09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I headed back out to Ocean Parkway. The sun was mostly set, but the sky still glowed a bit.</p>
