              <figcaption class="imageCaption">The side of the retail space that once housed Speedway Drugs; it’s now a Duane Reade and medical center. That door near the center of the picture is about where the old Speedway Drugs side door—that I
                used for exiting after grabbing stuff—used to be. (Photo by Jack Szwergold; Taken November 24, 2018)</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p name="0f05" id="0f05" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">It was another boring day in 1975 or 1976 and I — as a kid — was doing what I normally did on such a day: Play around with neighborhood kids on our block with occasional
              breaks to do something else.</p>
            <p name="fbc8" id="fbc8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And on this particular day I was playing in front of Speedway Drugs which was right next to my building on Ocean Parkway. It was a bright and sunny day and the air was filled
              with the smell of freshly cut grass in front of my building thanks to Johnny and his hand operated lawn mower.</p>
            <p name="2480" id="2480" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At some point — when I got bored doing whatever I was doing — I decided to go into Speedway Drugs to take a break and browse the toy rack.</p>
            <p name="c17c" id="c17c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I walked inside and waved to Jack the pharmacist behind the counter. He was a nice guy and I was personally proud to have the same name as someone as important as the pharmacist
              at the local corner drug store. It’s like I was a part of a special little “Jack” club.</p>
            <p name="d5f2" id="d5f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then I headed straight to the toy aisle and checked out what I could see on that rack. They always had a decent selection of cheap — but fun — rack toy stuff. And today, I
              spotted something right up my alley: Some plastic Civil War toy soldiers. One pack of Union soldiers and another pack of Confederate soldiers.</p>
            <p name="a338" id="a338" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now I wasn’t some kind of Civil War nut as a kid, but I learned about it on a basic level in elementary school and these figures looked cool. Unlike those classic, ubiquitous
              green toy soldier army men, these soldiers were made up multiple pieces of differently colored plastic and seemed to have more thought put into them. Some parts of them were flesh colored, others were navy blue or light grey with some
              parts dark green or dark brown. And damn, did I want them! But they were like $2.99 per pack and I had nothing saved up in my allowance to cover that kind of purchase. And besides, if I got a set of Union soldiers I would need to get
              another set of Confederate soldiers, right? So that’s like a $6 investment right there.</p>
            <p name="6899" id="6899" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I walked back to the front of the store, looked over the selection of items available in the vending machines near the store’s entrance and dejectedly walked back out into the
              afternoon sun empty-handed.</p>
            <p name="f38c" id="f38c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I walked outside I ran into some random neighborhood kid. Honestly don’t remember who, but he asked me what I got from the store. I mean, if you went into a store it was to
              get something right?</p>
            <p name="fbed" id="fbed" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Nothing,” I said. “Why?” he asked. “I don’t have enough money,” I said. “So what?” he responded as he turned his head and looked down the block.</p>
            <p name="fac3" id="fac3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I looked to where he was looking and then we both walked a bit down the block next to the side of Speedway and he pointed to the side door.</p>
            <p name="cece" id="cece" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“So what?” I said.</p>
            <p name="5d73" id="5d73" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You never went in to the store that way?” he asked and I shook my head “No…”</p>
            <p name="a96e" id="a96e" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Look, you can go into the store in the front and then shove stuff under your shirt and leave this way,” he said looking at me with this “You know
              what I mean?” look on his face.</p>
            <p name="eac9" id="eac9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I knew what he meant. But that was stealing and that was wrong so I asked, “But that’s stealing?” and he responded, “So what?” with an ambivalent shrug.</p>
            <p name="c221" id="c221" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We were both kids and I guess this was my childhood introduction to shoplifting. So I asked, “What if we get caught? I don’t want to get in trouble.</p>
            <p name="03f9" id="03f9" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Don’t worry!” he said. “Let’s just do it,” he added.</p>
            <p name="e451" id="e451" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">So with that we both walked into the store to do the deed.</p>

            <p name="5a0e" id="5a0e" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">While I was a little tense and my palms were sweaty, he seemed cool; I guess that’s because he did this before.</p>
            <p name="47a1" id="47a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We walked up to the toy rack and I showed him the Civil War figures. “They look cool!” he said. Then he moved around from one side of me to another and said, “You first.” I
              looked at him, looked at Jack the pharmacist behind the counter — who was not looking at us — and then looked at the toys.</p>
            <p name="bfb3" id="bfb3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I pulled out the front of my t-shirt and shoved one pack of Civil War soldiers under my shirt while trying to hold it inconspicuously as if it wasn’t right there shoved under my
              shirt. He went ahead and grabbed another set and did the same thing.</p>
            <p name="3f8b" id="3f8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We both then carefully — and inconspicuously — walked to the side door. I opened the door, went outside and he followed close behind. The afternoon sun was bright and almost
              blinding. And as the door swung closed, without missing a beat, we ran straight up the block towards my building and leapt over the small brick wall, down the slight alley — where they made oil deliveries — and into the building lobby.
            </p>
            <p name="a574" id="a574" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A safe distance away from the store, I pulled out the pack of soldiers I had under my shirt and he pulled the pack he had and gave it to me.</p>
            <p name="965e" id="965e" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Wow!” I said, “We did it!” I added. “See!” he said, “No problem!” he added.</p>
            <p name="e4a6" id="e4a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I gave him a high five and he went back outside to play with other kids. I felt like I owed him something for the effort, but he seemed like a pro at this kinda kid shoplifting
              stuff so he just smiled and didn’t say much more or ask for anything. He was simply sharing some knowledge he had with me and not much else.</p>
            <p name="c7c7" id="c7c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I buzzed the buzzer and my dad let me in. I was so in the moment after that shoplifting escapade I completely forgot that I had those packs of toys in my hand as my dad opened
              the apartment door and I headed inside.</p>
            <p name="65d9" id="65d9" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“What are those?” my dad asked. “Where did you get them?” he added. I stood there and paused for a second and said, “I got them from some friends,” I
              said. “I traded some stuff for them,” I quickly added.</p>
            <p name="e630" id="e630" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">He looked at me and accepted what I said at face value but was clearly not that convinced. But at least he didn’t take them away from me and that was what was
              important.</p>

            <p name="74c6" id="74c6" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">I headed into my room, opened up the packages and played with those toys. Like most rack toys, they weren’t the greatest toys in the world, but they were definitely really cool
              to look at. Before you knew it I had some improvised Civil War action happening on my floor.</p>
            <p name="2b60" id="2b60" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Later that evening, my dad came into my room to give me dinner and asked me about those toys again, “Friends gave those to you?” he asked. And I said, “Yes! I traded stuff for
              them.” And he again accepted what I said but still seemed skeptical.</p>
            <p name="66b8" id="66b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I got up of of the floor to go and eat but also made sure to put the soldiers out on my desk and put them on display with some of the other stuff I had on my desk.
              Honestly, they were nicer to look at than play with.</p>

            <p name="fe5f" id="fe5f" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">The next day I woke up and it was a seemingly normal day. My dad was up earlier than me and was out shopping and I was putzing around my room doing not much of anything as per
              usual.</p>
            <p name="e238" id="e238" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I played around with those Civil War figures some more when I started to get bored and decided I should just go outside and do something else.</p>
            <p name="82ba" id="82ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I ran downstairs, met up with some neighborhood kids and played around with them for a while.</p>
            <p name="a7f5" id="a7f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then my dad showed up and said he wanted to talk to me.</p>
            <p name="df69" id="df69" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Where did you get those toys?” he said a bit more sternly than the other times he asked the same question. To which I said what I said before, “I got
              them from a friend.”</p>
            <p name="d7fc" id="d7fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">He looked at me exasperatedly and said we needed to go upstairs. So upstairs we went.</p>

            <p name="f35d" id="f35d" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">When we got upstairs he went into my room with me, and told me to take a few of the Civil War toys downstairs with me. He wasn’t exactly angry but he wasn’t exactly happy either.
            </p>
            <p name="8afe" id="8afe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I took a few of the toys, and he said we needed to go downstairs. My mom shouted, “What’s happening?” and my dad responded to her in Yiddish or Polish as we walked out of the
              apartment.</p>
            <p name="c708" id="c708" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All the way downstairs my dad looked at me weirdly. “Where are we going?” I asked. “To Speedway,” he said. “We need to talk to Jack.” he added.</p>
            <p name="6ad9" id="6ad9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Now I started to understand what was happening.</p>

            <p name="8741" id="8741" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">I should say something like the walk to the corner felt like an eternity or nonsense like that. It didn’t. It was actually a nice day and it was around dusk and the sky was nice
              to look at and calm. The ocean breeze still in the air and it was an overall chill night.</p>
            <p name="21e0" id="21e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But then when I took my first steps inside of Speedway, I started to feel tense and a bit nervous and disoriented. My hands started to sweat as I held onto my plastic Civil War
              soldiers in my jacket pockets.</p>
            <p name="b947" id="b947" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Jack the pharmacist was behind the counter and greeted my dad with a smile. But he — and some other woman behind the counter — soon put on a shameful scowl as he looked down
              towards me.</p>
            <p name="6220" id="6220" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Jack,” my dad said to me, “Show Jack the toys you have.”</p>
            <p name="7b1e" id="7b1e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And nervously I pulled a few Civil War soldiers and related junk out of my pocket and held them up so Jack the pharmacist could see them.</p>
            <p name="97a8" id="97a8" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Yeah,” Jack the pharmacist said. “Those are the ones that he took,” he added.</p>
            <p name="1a32" id="1a32" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My dad then leaned down and looked me in the face and said with a thick, deliberate accent, “Why did you do this?”</p>
            <p name="e004" id="e004" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I looked at him, looked around me, then looked down and just felt like crying, but didn’t. I just turned my head up, looked at my dad and said, “I don’t know.”</p>
            <p name="bb99" id="bb99" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He looked at me, shook me a bit by one of my shoulders and said, “Don’t do this again, right?” And I quietly and slowly nodded and said, “Okay…” as he stood up and asked Jack the
              pharmacist how much he owed him for the toys.</p>
            <p name="80f3" id="80f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Jack said something like, “No… Don’t worry…” but my dad insisted that he take some money so I saw a few dollar bills pass from my dad’s hands to the counter.</p>
            <p name="d649" id="d649" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Jack the pharmacist took the money and then looked at me and said, “Don’t steal!” and I nodded silently in agreement. Shortly after that, my dad and I were outside on the street
              walking back home.</p>
            <p name="a95a" id="a95a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">When we got to the front of our building, my dad stayed downstairs to gossip with some of the other folks who were just hanging around out in front of the building
              as they always did. I said goodbye to him and headed back upstairs to play around with the Civil War soldiers on my desk before heading to bed for the night.</p>
