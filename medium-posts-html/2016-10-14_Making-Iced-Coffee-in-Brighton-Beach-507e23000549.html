            <p name="bda9" id="bda9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">My brother and his wife were 20 years older than me and visited our family in Brooklyn so frequently their presence in my life degraded from being mildly annoying to viscerally
              toxic as time went on.</p>
            <p name="f4c9" id="f4c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At this point someone might imply I should be saying something like “It’s not I did not like them from the beginning…” or some flowery “Well all love each other!” bullshit like
              that. But truth be told I never liked them from the moment I met them as a young kid: Pushy, stubborn, judgmental, conceited, overbearing, smug and self-important; and it took me decades to finally know what those specific words even
              meant so I could use them to describe my brother and his wife with words other than the always appropriate “assholes.”</p>
            <p name="cd5c" id="cd5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So anyway, when they showed up my family would be greeted to cursory, superficial pleasantries followed by seemingly hours of passive aggressive — and sometimes just plain old
              aggressive — nonsense. They would deride my parents food while shoving their faces full of it, they would compliment me on my computer skills while berating me for playing video games I enjoyed… The list was fairly endless but when they
              showed up, I learned I had to put some proverbial armor on to deal with their unique, negative approach to basic human interactions.</p>
            <p name="69d7" id="69d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why did my parents tolerate it? Heck, why did I tolerate it? Easy! They’re family and you’re supposed to support and welcome family no matter what; even if you disagree with
              them. And who was I, a mere teenager, to say anything to my older brother and his wife anyway. I mean they had a knack for subtle, selfish manipulation and humiliation that border-lined on being sociopathic and that’s not an easy thing
              to call someone out on when you’re a teenager who doesn’t even know what big words like those meant at the time.</p>
            <p name="7905" id="7905" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But sometimes my brother and his wife weren’t so subtle. Like on the day my brother’s wife decided to arrogantly chew my dad out about his inability to make iced coffee.</p>
            <p name="77fb" id="77fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The day seemed like any other: A lazy spring/summer Saturday in the early 1980s. I was just sitting on the floor of my room reading comics and magazines while listening to music
              on the radio. The sun was coming into the room and I felt safe for once since at no point — past an initial “Hello!” — did my brother and his wife decide to be pushy and land their self-important asses in my room to “hang out” with me
              as if I enjoyed being with them.</p>
            <p name="f6e6" id="f6e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some time later I pushed the comics and magazines aside and started to doze off for an afternoon nap. Just as I was entering dreamland I suddenly heard some kind of shouting
              coming from the kitchen. I woke up but didn’t say or do anything; it was unclear what was happening. Then suddenly my dad came into my room — clearly flustered — and asked me, “Do you know what iced coffee is?” I said “No,” as I stood
              up and shook my head around to wake up.</p>
            <p name="3422" id="3422" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As I got up on my feet I could hear more shouting — combined with the clanging of pots and pans — coming from kitchen which was on the other side of the apartment. With slight
              hesitation, I walked out of my room, down the hallway and made my way towards the kitchen. I had no idea what was happening but the closer I got I knew one thing: My brother’s wife was flipping out about something.</p>
            <p name="9ddc" id="9ddc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I walked into the kitchen, I had no idea what to think: I’m seeing my brother’s wife angrily lecture my parents on how to make iced coffee as my mom and dad sat stunned and
              frustrated a the kitchen table. My brother’s wife is pushing a kettle on the stove, lighting the burner on the stove, grabbing a large glass and tossing ice from the refrigerator into the glass. It was basically a frenzy of frustration;
              someone doing something in a way that’s superficially presented as “showing” someone how to do something when in reality said person is just having an entitled rage tantrum.</p>
            <p name="275d" id="275d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At this point you need to know that my brother’s wife was trained as a teacher; a math teacher specifically. So you would think she would have respect for basic human respect and
              boundaries when showing others how to do something or explaining a simple process, right? Well, not in this case.</p>
            <p name="1e32" id="1e32" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Before you knew it this college educated graduate of the prestigious Bank Street School of Education had finally made her beloved iced coffee. How she made that iced coffee is
              still unclear to me: We only had Maxwell House instant coffee in our home so she must have boiled the water, poured it into the glass that had a tablespoon of Maxwell House coffee in it, stirred it a bit, added ice, added milk and et
              voilà! Iced coffee, right?</p>
            <p name="9dce" id="9dce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But honestly, the only specific lesson I remembered from that day was a new version of the same bullshit “lesson” that miserable human — and my older brother — sent my family
              with each visit/encounter: We had no idea how to do anything, our lives were laughable, our food was garbage, our ideas were garbage, how we lived was garbage but you know what? We should somehow be lucky someone so miserable is coming
              into our pitiful little home to show us all how to behave.</p>
            <p name="e767" id="e767" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So with that done, she finally noticed I was standing there — oblivious to the stone-faced expression on my face — and cheerily offered me a sip of her iced coffee. I took a sip:
              It tasted like cold instant coffee in a juice glass. “It tastes good, right?” she said as she took the glass back and started sipping it herself and nodding a “Yes…” towards me as if we were in assumed agreement or something. I didn’t
              respond but mumbled, “Yeah…” or something and slowly walked away back to my room.</p>
            <p name="afa2" id="afa2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">After a while, my brother and his wife happily left. My dad came into my room and asked me what I thought of the iced coffee and my only response was to make a
              scowling face and point my thumbs down as I adjusted myself to lay down on the small couch in my room. “Well, it’s not so bad!” he said as he left the room. But to me, even if the iced coffee was amazing the tedious, miserable, berating
              behavior of my brother’s wife would have ruined any enjoyment I could get from consuming it. It’s as if she truly believed — and still believes — that she was doing my family a favor by acting nasty, selfish and entitled.</p>
