            <p name="bfd3" id="bfd3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">We all called the store “the Te-Amo” but it was basically a junky — but beloved — neighborhood newsstand and candy store.</p>
            <p name="5029" id="5029" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Te-Amo wasn’t the name of the store as much as it was the name of a brand of cheap Mexican cigars that as sold around various corner stores across New York City at the time. Part
              of their marketing in the city in the 1970s was to pay for new signs for shops that carried their goods with one stipulation: Their branding would be the largest thing on the sign.</p>
            <p name="8d24" id="8d24" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So the newsstand that was near Brighton 6th Street was dubbed “the Te-Amo” by most everyone in the neighborhood because there wasn’t another one nearby at the time. There was an
              “Optimo” a few blocks away but that’s a whole other story.</p>
            <p name="7408" id="7408" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Around 1978, the store was still an old drug store at one point that then became a newsstand at some point in its history. I don’t recall who the original owner of the place was,
              but I recall them being Italian or Jewish and had thick rimmed glasses and were generally nice to kids. There was always some kind of nickel candy and generally and array of crap that would appeal to kids who went to nearby P.S. 253.
            </p>
            <p name="88e6" id="88e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">And beyond the candy, comics, trading cards, pranks, novelties and other random fun crap they had for sale, they — at least in my humble opinion — had one of the
              best selection of Matchbox cars in the neighborhood.</p>

          <div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn">
            <p name="efc8" id="efc8" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Matchbox cars was my thing as a kid. More than comics or anything else.</p>
            <p name="2bd8" id="2bd8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For $1 and some change, Matchbox cars were a decent value for kids who wanted to collect cool and sturdy play stuff.</p>
            <p name="4b9e" id="4b9e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Unlike modern toys that you just impulsively grabbed off of a rack at a store, back then the way it worked was there would be a display of that year’s Matchbox cars and each had
              a number connected to them.</p>
            <p name="00ff" id="00ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you wanted a specific car, you just had to look over the selection of cars in the display case, tell the guy behind the counter what number you wanted, handed over that dollar
              and change and et voila, you got a literal small matchbox-ish-sized box that had your car in it.</p>
            <p name="0e6e" id="0e6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I really liked buying Matchbox cars from this store since the owners were nice to kids and always had a decent stock of Matchbox cars. And since it was around the
              corner from P.S. 253, I could window shop each day when I headed home from school and would wait for the weekend — and my allowance — to happen to finally pull the trigger and blow a $1 or two on some Matchbox cars.</p>

            <p name="5f89" id="5f89" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">One day when I was headed to school and walked by the Te-Amo, and noticed something weird. The newspapers and magazines outside in front of the store weren’t exactly as organized
              as they usually were. Ditto with some of the candy in the street facing display case. I took a quick peek inside the store and I didn’t see the original owners, but some new guys who looked Indian or Pakistani. What was happening? I was
              curious, but didn’t have time to investigate any further since I had to head to school.</p>
            <p name="f432" id="f432" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Later on, after school let out, I headed into the store and it was pretty clear what happened: The store had new owners. The place wasn’t as well organized as it was a week or so
              back and the guys behind the counter were unfriendly and barked things like “What do you want?” and “Buy something or leave!” to any kid that wandered around the shop.</p>
            <p name="d27e" id="d27e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I headed out and headed home; the place didn’t feel the same anymore to say the least.</p>

            <p name="4a12" id="4a12" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">A week or so passed. I wasn’t consciously boycotting the Te-Amo, but subconsciously I avoided it as much as possible after the last visit. But after a while my urge to window
              shop Matchbox cars was just too strong.</p>
            <p name="7535" id="7535" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was a nice-ish weekend day, I had a few dollars of allowance money in my pocket and felt like treating myself to a brand new Matchbox car.</p>
            <p name="331d" id="331d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I looked over the selection of cars in the display case and spotted a car I wanted: Number 21! Which was a Renault 5TL. I know, that sounds boring but I really liked practical
              non-sporty cars like that so I asked the guy for car number 21.</p>
            <p name="a861" id="a861" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The guy looked befuddled and confused about what I was asking about. He turned to his co-worker who rummaged through some boxes on a shelf and handled me a number 21 box… But
              this was not a Renault 5TL, it was some oddball construction vehicle Matchbox dubbed a “Rod Roller” that was last year’s model 21. I didn’t want that thing and passed it back to the guy.</p>
            <p name="a1b7" id="a1b7" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I want number 21!” I said.</p>
            <p name="76c1" id="76c1" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“This is number 21!” the guy behind the counter shouted.</p>
            <p name="3b95" id="3b95" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“No it isn’t!” I said and then pointed out hat was number 21 in the display.</p>
            <p name="8a90" id="8a90" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some old coot hanging out near the Lottery area heckled me and said, “Maybe the kid wants to go to the ’21 Club!’” and poked his old coot finger near my face.</p>
            <p name="6420" id="6420" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I waved his hand away and walked to the display case and pointed out the car at number 21 in the display wasn’t the same car he gave me. The guy behind the counter and his
              partner looked at the number 21 in the display case, noticed the difference, said something to each other in a foreign language I didn’t understand and then said, “Sorry, we don’t have it.”</p>
            <p name="02e7" id="02e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dejected I asked if I could buy the car in the display case and one of them simply shouted, “No!” and then grabbed the car out of the display case to shove into the storage area
              behind the counter.</p>
            <p name="9d25" id="9d25" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I left the place pissed off and unhappy. The new owners had no idea what they were selling and they were treating me — an 11 year old kid — like some kinda threat to their
              business.</p>
            <p name="8475" id="8475" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I told my dad what happened and he went out with me the next day to see if he could get them to sell me that number 21 Renault 5TL. Still, no luck for me; they wouldn’t sell it.
              To make things even worse the guys behind the counter said that all I was doing was making trouble so they wouldn’t sell the car to me.</p>
            <p name="50d6" id="50d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Me and my dad left the place and my dad said that they were acting crazy. “Why don’t they want to sell it to you? The money is the same!” my dad said as we walked back down the
              avenue.</p>
            <p name="b256" id="b256" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">***</p>
            <p name="de1f" id="de1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After that incident, I began to consciously and deliberately boycott the Te-Amo. If they were going to be jerks, I wouldn’t give them the pleasure of getting the 5 to 25 cents I
              might occasionally spend on them for candy and trading cards.</p>
            <p name="164e" id="164e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This lasted for a few week, but then one day I peeked in the front door and saw they had rearranged things a bit. They even had a new Matchbox car display case on a rotating
              carousel near the back and away from the front counter.</p>
            <p name="3b1e" id="3b1e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Curious, I went in to investigate. The display case was nice, new and clean, but the cars were displayed in some kind of haphazard, thoughtless way. I could tell some cars were
              in the wrong slots because their numbers didn’t match what I remembered as being their proper numbers in the collector’s catalog I had.</p>
            <p name="6e1d" id="6e1d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Still, they had some cool stuff that I wanted and — as I slowly rotated the display case — I noticed a gap in the clear plastic on the front of the display case. I felt the edges
              and played around with it with my tip finger and realized I could easily push up the clear plastic on the front of the display case. I looked up, glanced at the front counter, saw the guys behind the counter looking away while they
              dealt with another customer and decided to make my move: I quickly pushed the front of the display case up, grabbed a car and dropped it into my jacket pocket.</p>
            <p name="1086" id="1086" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My heart was racing at a mile a minute and my palms were sweaty, but I did it! Now I just had to leave the store. So I slowly walked towards the entrance.</p>
            <p name="6e50" id="6e50" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Hey!” the guy behind the counter shouted, “What do you want!” he added. I shrugged, walked out the front door and ran down the block.</p>
            <p name="47aa" id="47aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Once I crossed Brighton 5th street I looked behind me and started to calm down a bit. I was expecting to see the store owner chasing me down the block but I didn’t see him. I
              breathed a sigh of relief and kept on walking.</p>
            <p name="d66f" id="d66f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After walking a few more blocks I pulled the car out of my pocket and looked it over a bit. I gotta admit I don’t remember exactly what model I stole that day, but I was happy to
              have stolen it.</p>
            <p name="e9f4" id="e9f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It wasn’t the car as much as the principle of the whole thing: The new owners of the Te-Amo always treated neighborhood kids as being no better than thieves, so why not steal
              from them?</p>
            <p name="5f5b" id="5f5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">When I got home I showed the car to my dad. He thought it was nice in that way parents thought all things their kids do or have things were nice. He had no idea I
              stole it and to me, it didn’t matter if he did.</p>
