            <p name="ff12" id="ff12" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">It was sometime in the mid 1970s and one of my favorite childhood pastimes was getting out of the apartment and running around outside. Literally just that: Getting out of
              the apartment, emerging into the outside world of Ocean Parkway and running around; playing with other kids and all that.</p>
            <p name="7f9b" id="7f9b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As boring as that might sound, but when you are about 8 years old, 3 to 4 feet tall and have tons of energy (and sugar) in you, running around outside was fun.</p>
            <p name="59b8" id="59b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You could run around and do some nonsense with friends. Nonsense like running around as a small group of kids, playing in front yard, exploring garbage cans for toys and junk and
              stuff like that.</p>
            <p name="c7d0" id="c7d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Before buildings started to lock up basement passageways and such, you could run around between and behind all of the buildings on the block. This was all kinds of fun on it’s
              own because as you ran through basement passages, air shafts and alleys you could find all kinds of things people accidentally dropped from windows. Like clothes pins, balls, toys and matchbooks.</p>
            <p name="82d9" id="82d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">But one thing I remembered the most were the literal alley cats and kittens that I would occasionally run into.</p>

            <p name="1d35" id="1d35" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">There was this one nice Italian old lady on the other side of our building that would care for the cats. She had some in her apartment but she also cared for the strays out
              behind the building and in the air shaft.</p>
            <p name="561e" id="561e" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing">“Be careful! Don’t scare the cats!” she would shout at us from her kitchen window when we ran around. And we listened. Maybe not
              exactly to her since the cats always ran away from us as we played so the request was silly to begin with. But we still listened because she cared for the cats and she let the kids play.</p>

            <p name="ed69" id="ed69" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">One day her advice came to the fore when I ran through a set of basement stairs, entered the airway and then — at eye level — I saw a bunch of meowing kittens laying down around
              a piece of chicken wrapped in join foil.</p>
            <p name="9832" id="9832" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have seen kittens before and I have seen discarded food before, but this sight was one of the most disturbing things I had seen in my short life at that point: The chicken
              parts were covered in maggots, and the mewing kittens had maggots crawling all over their faces as well. The kittens were young enough that their eyes weren’t open yet, and the maggots were crawling all over their faces because the
              kittens were clearly hungry and occasionally tried to eat the chicken. A little plastic take-out container had the last remnants of some water in in. The sight triggered a level of discomfort in my young self I had never felt before.
            </p>
            <p name="2463" id="2463" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I ran out of the basement and headed to the front of the building and looked for help. My dad was there gossiping with everyone else. I ran over and breathlessly explained what I
              saw and how he had to help. Just as I was explaining things to my dad, Johnny the super came outside. My dad explained things to him and we all walked over to the basement stairs to go investigate.</p>
            <p name="4d0f" id="4d0f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We all went into the passageway, came out the other side and saw the kittens in the same sad state as they were before. “Wow!” Johnny said as my dad looked on and gasped.</p>
            <p name="8776" id="8776" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Johnny carefully shoved aside the kittens and grabbed the aluminum foil with the chicken parts. He walked back to the front of the building to toss it in the garbage.</p>
            <p name="143b" id="143b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My dad and I remained looking at the maggot covered kittens and wondering what to do. After a minute or so, the Italian cat lady opened her window and said, “What’s happening?”
            </p>
            <p name="c607" id="c607" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We pointed the kittens, she looked down, gasped and said, “Hang on!” She closed the window to her apartment and then came downstairs. Her hair was under some kind of plastic bag
              (maybe she was doing something with it) and she was dressed in a house dress and slippers and was carrying a small bath towel. She approached the kittens and just scooped them all up in the towel and moved closer to us to show them to
              us.</p>
            <p name="384d" id="384d" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“They’ll be fine. They’ll be fine.” She said as she simultaneously held them and tried to wipe the maggots away with the edge of the towel.</p>
            <p name="d8a0" id="d8a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They looked particularly dank and junky in the clean, white towel she had but it was clearly something a quick bath and cleaning could deal with.</p>
            <p name="f6f8" id="f6f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With that she walked back to her apartment; kittens mewing all the way while she walked back to the air shaft door.</p>
            <p name="37e9" id="37e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">My dad and I wished her well and we headed back outside to the front of the building.</p>

            <p name="2342" id="2342" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I smiled, stood around some more and — when I got bored — headed back inside.</p>
