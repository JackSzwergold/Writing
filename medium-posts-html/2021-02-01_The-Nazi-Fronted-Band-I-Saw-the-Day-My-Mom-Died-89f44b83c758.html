            <p name="7c40" id="7c40" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">On the night of May 29, 1993 my mom — a Holocaust survivor — died. Earlier that day I flew out to Madison, Wisconsin to visit friends and to take a break from weeks of going
              to Coney Island Hospital — pretty much daily — to visit and care for her.</p>
            <p name="bb9f" id="bb9f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I arrived that night, we all headed out to O’Cayz Corral on East Wilson Street to see some local bands: One of the bands on the bill was Buttress, a local spazz-rock noise
              band.</p>
            <p name="bc9c" id="bc9c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I remember standing outside waiting to get in and looking at the logo: The word “Buttress” had two crucifixes replacing the two “T”s in the name and the “S”’s were replaced by
              the Nazi SS symbol. Flyer for another show below for reference.</p>
            <p name="7a69" id="7a69" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I made some comment about it, but everyone was in full “It’s ironic… Don’t worry…” mode. So we went in to see the band, and honestly they were okay. Soon someone
              in the house I was staying in came to the bar and told me I had to call home immediately.went to the payphone in the foyer of the nearby Cardinal Bar, called my family, heard the bad news and then ran back to my friends in O’Cayz. We
              all left and headed back to their place. I basically just had a beer, slept and then headed back to Brooklyn the next morning.</p>

            <p name="e0c6" id="e0c6" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Flash forward to September 2000. I was working at the wacky weekly newspaper since 1995 and a lot of us were going to move to New York. Todd — one of the writers on
              staff — invited me over to check out his new 32” TV and the new PlayStation and recently released “Spider-Man” game he scored.</p>
            <p name="63fd" id="63fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The TV and video game was a big deal because this guy was a loser who never had a decent paying job. But now — thanks to the wacky weekly newspaper’s 1990s rise to fame — was
              able to have more disposable money. So he “splurged” on a TV set and a video game.</p>
            <p name="6782" id="6782" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Just as I was about to leave, one of this Todd’s pals came by: Greg P. the lead singer of the band with the Nazi SS symbol in their logo. I was introduced to Greg P. and he gave
              me a weak, tepid handshake and simply said, “Oh… You’re the Jew, right?”</p>
            <p name="83fc" id="83fc" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I guess?” I responded as I said goodbye and left myself out.</p>
            <p name="34b2" id="34b2" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“The Jew?” where did this a-hole get that from? Could only be from my loser writer colleague Todd who gossiped to his pals — like Greg P. — about me
              and somehow “The Jew” summarized it.</p>
            <p name="99e0" id="99e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s a lot I can say about this Todd’s persona: If any of his behavior — not just this thing — happened during the “MeToo” era, he would have been cancelled in a flash. But in
              the shadows of a pre-social media world, he was able to grow a sad, barely viable, career while being an utter creep.</p>
            <p name="15c7" id="15c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And as for Greg P. and Buttress… Little to nothing about the band really exists online. Good for him!</p>
            <p name="7d19" id="7d19" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The band logo was one thing… But when Greg P. in Buttress referred to me as “The Jew” that just sealed the deal. That band was just a bunch of Midwest redneck racists.</p>
            <p name="de1d" id="de1d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Oh, and here’s another flyer I found for reference; they sure as hell loved fascist imagery!</p>
