            <p name="55f2" id="55f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">In the 1970s, Howie was a good neighborhood friend. I didn’t go to school with him — like most of the other kids I knew at the time — but we saw each other pretty much every
              day during that small slide of outdoor “play in the streets” time that existed between 3:00pm-ish and 6:00pm-ish each day.</p>
            <p name="a689" id="a689" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was the summer and his birthday was coming up and everyone on the block was excited. Nobody on the block ever had a big, overblown birthday party but all celebrations in the
              neighborhood — big and small — were special. We were all excited to wish him a happy birthday and get a small “loot bag” of random fun crap that every parent seemed to give every kid back then.</p>
            <p name="9b9f" id="9b9f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These loot bags were small, simple and mainly filled with novelties and other junk us kids would typically get from a vending machine on the corner from anywhere from 5 cents to
              25 cents a pop. But now — thanks to the celebration of someone’s something special event — we got to get a small bag of this fun junk for free. And that’s really all us kids wanted: Free and fun junk.</p>
            <p name="73cd" id="73cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of the the things Howie and I usually did was informally compare notes on where we could find fun junk. Back in the 1970s, it wasn’t like you could only get toys at one
              special toy store. Tons of the cool stuff would usually be found on the racks of corner stores and delis. Stuff that was sold to shop owners by random door to door salesmen or local distributors dumping stuff on local stores as some
              kind of bonus for the owner buying a pile of something else. And past that, there was mail order.</p>
            <p name="d3eb" id="d3eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t think I was fully aware of the Johnson Smith catalog back then — a very cool and well known novelty catalog filled with all kinds of stuff — but we did share tips on cool
              stuff we saw in more commonly available items, like comics as well as what we spotted in local store.</p>
            <p name="df32" id="df32" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Look! Trick candles!” Howie said as he showed me a page of ads in some oddball superhero comic I wasn’t familiar with at the time. I have no idea
              what comic it was since I was mainly into “Archie” comics at the time, but that didn’t matter. What did matter was seeing that teeny, tiny ad with as series of distinct “before/after” illustrations: One was some kid blowing out the
              candles of the cake, the next the candles appeared unlit and then in the last panel — as if by magic — the flames of the candles were lit again.</p>
            <p name="d1d6" id="d1d6" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You can never blow them out!” he said. And that was cool. But none of us had the money, care or time to mail order it. For a kid, mail ordering was a
              whole production that often involved parents being aware of something arriving in the mail and such. And none of us had the time to deal with the domestic politics of a scene like that.</p>
            <p name="a9bd" id="a9bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">So the dream of owning and using trick candles had to be put on hold.</p>

            <p name="ce70" id="ce70" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Flash forward a few days and while out shopping with my dad around Brighton 6th Street I asked if we could stop inside of a stationery store called “Cameo” so I could see what
              fun junk I could spot inside the shop and he agreed.</p>
            <p name="98cd" id="98cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I went inside and poked around to see what I could see. But it seemed like the same batch of the same old same old and such and nothing that interested me… Until I spied
              something on a rack right next to piles of number-shaped candles: A pack of trick candles! I was shocked! This place had trick candles? Where did they get them from? No matter… I had to score them!</p>
            <p name="1fc0" id="1fc0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I checked the price on the pack of trick candles — which was about $1.50 or so — then checked my pocket change and realized had just enough to score them.</p>
            <p name="074f" id="074f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I ran out of the store holding a small paper bag that had the candles and proudly showed the candles to my dad. He looked at the package and carefully read the
              writing, “‘Trick Candles?’ We have candles! Why do you need this? What are trick candles?” I just smiled and shrugged and headed back home.</p>

            <p name="6ebd" id="6ebd" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">When I got home — and settled down in my room — I looked at the package of trick candles with awe and wonder. They were still sealed in their little plastic bubble that was glued
              to the cardboard backing board and — to my young eyes — they seemed just like your everyday, normal, basic, run-of-the-mill tiny blue birthday cake candles. But looking at the wick at the top revealed a small difference: The wick on the
              trick candles were a little bit thicker — and grayer — than normal candles.</p>
            <p name="2531" id="2531" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I really wanted to try one of them out to see how they worked, but was genuinely afraid I would burn down the apartment. And nobody wanted that.</p>
            <p name="26ac" id="26ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Instead I thought about Howie’s upcoming birthday, and how I could surprise him with these magical trick candles we both wanted to see in action.</p>

            <p name="3fba" id="3fba" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">A few days passed and it was time for Howie’s birthday. I almost forgot about it to be honest with you until someone I was playing outside with mentioned it to me. I rushed up
              the stairs of my building, ran into my apartment, grabbed the trick candles out of my desk, shoved them in my pocket and headed straight outside.</p>
            <p name="8815" id="8815" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today was the day!</p>
            <p name="3264" id="3264" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My plan was to use the trick candles on Howie’s birthday cake. We would all watch him struggle to blow out the candles, and then — just as he was at the edge of being really
              frustrated — I would pull out my gift for him: The pack of remaining trick candles he wanted! What a perfect plan, right?</p>
            <p name="b4fd" id="b4fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anyway, so I was back outside playing around when Howie’s mom showed up and invited us all upstairs to celebrate Howie’s birthday.</p>
            <p name="02ad" id="02ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We all followed her up the stairs of the building they lived in and followed her into their family’s apartment. It was like everyone else’s apartment in the neighborhood back
              then: Small dinky and somewhat crammed. The birthday cake was in the kitchen that was small, dinky and crammed as well.</p>
            <p name="2394" id="2394" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As everyone jockeyed for position, I was trying to figure out how to swap out the candles; which happily weren’t lit yet. I don’t recall what birthday we were celebrating at the
              time, but it was a good bet this was his 8th birthday. So I figured I had to somehow quickly swap out 8 candles.</p>
            <p name="b229" id="b229" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of our mutual neighborhood friends, Arthur, noticed me thinking a bit too much and asked what was up. I showed him the trick candles and told him what I wanted to do. “Cool!”
              he said.</p>
            <p name="31a2" id="31a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With that we both looked around and happily realized that somehow we were the only ones left in the kitchen; this was our chance! And with that we both scrambled to swap out the
              candles before anyone came back. Which was easier to do than expected since the candles were placed in those small, dinky plastic holders that everyone used at the time.</p>
            <p name="5c35" id="5c35" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Within less than a minute we were done. I took the already swapped out “normal” candles and shoved them into my pocket, making sure to separate them from pack of remaining trick
              candles I had.</p>
            <p name="9d59" id="9d59" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Soon enough Howie’s mom and few other kids came back into the kitchen. “Shhhh…” his mom said as she started to light the candles, “We want to surprise him,” she added.</p>
            <p name="a586" id="a586" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As she lit the candles, I looked at their wicks and wondered how they worked. They superficially seemed the same as regular candles even when lit, so I was extra psyched by this
              whole thing.</p>
            <p name="8096" id="8096" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Just as she lit the last candle, we heard the front door locks on the apartment jostle and — soon enough — the front door was opened. Howie’s dad came in first followed by Howie
              right behind.</p>
            <p name="3b5a" id="3b5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As his dad put bags of stuff down on the living room couch he shouted, “Howie! Check what mom made for you in the kitchen.” And with that Howie walked in and we all shouted
              “Happy Birthday!”</p>
            <p name="9817" id="9817" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Howie was clearly stunned and happy as he walked in, sat down at the table and looked at the birthday cake. For all intents and purposes, the cake looked like a normal cake. But
              then I noticed the icing was slowly getting smoother and shinier as time passed. “Blow out the candles Howie!” his mom said, “The ice cream is going to melt!” she added.</p>
            <p name="bd94" id="bd94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ice cream? It was an ice cream cake! And I had no idea since I never saw the box it came in and the cake looked like every round, frosted yellow cake I had ever seen. But after
              she said that I looked in the trash and there it was: An empty Carvel ice cream cake box from around the corner. Damn! I liked cake, ice cream and Carvel ice cream specifically so this was going to be good!</p>
            <p name="cd0f" id="cd0f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But then — as Howie attempted to blow out the candles — cracks in my brilliant prank/gift plans started to appear. Yeah, Howie was getting visibility frustrated trying to blow
              out the trick candles. And I carefully watched as the seemingly blown out candle wicks would magically — and literally — spark back to life. So it was cool seeing how those damned things worked. But as Howie got more and more
              frustrated, the ice cream cake beneath the candles was clearly melting more and more.</p>
            <p name="d8a0" id="d8a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Was it because of the heat generated by the trick candles? Was it because the heat of the hot, New York summer day? Was it because of heat from a pile of people stuck in a
              crammed kitchen in a badly ventilated tenement apartment?</p>
            <p name="0a02" id="0a02" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Who knew.</p>
            <p name="84e7" id="84e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All I knew is the fact those trick candles weren’t blowing out right away on each of the many attempts Howie made to blow them out didn’t really help much. And I was starting to
              feel guilty about it all. So I blurted out, “They’re trick candles! They won’t blow out!” And then added, “I’m sorry.”</p>
            <p name="b82e" id="b82e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And with that his mom rushed over to the cake and pulled out the candles as his dad grabbed the cake to cut it up so we could all have a slice.</p>
            <p name="83c1" id="83c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The ice cream icing was a bit melted, but the main core of the ice cream cake was still solid so it was not a complete loss. But Howie clearly wasn’t that happy about what just
              happened.</p>
            <p name="1888" id="1888" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Here,” I said as I walked over and handled him his gift: The pack of remaining trick candles. His face was a bit red — and there were some tears near
              his eyes — from getting upset about the trick candles, but he wiped them away and became focused on the remaining trick candles once I gave them to him.</p>
            <p name="f422" id="f422" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Where did you get them?” he asked. “Cameo,” I said. “Sorry about the cake,” I added.</p>
            <p name="d5b6" id="d5b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He wiped his face a bit and said, “Nah… No big deal.” “The cake is still good,” he added as he dipped his fork into an ice cream cake slice and put the unused trick candles on
              the table right next to it.</p>
            <p name="5837" id="5837" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">His parents and friends weren’t that upset either. But I made note of what happened since it was the first prank I ever pulled on anyone and it wasn’t exactly as
              much fun as I thought it would be.</p>
