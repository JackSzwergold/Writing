            <p name="17c7" id="17c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The first time I met John people told me how he had previously headed to New York City to make it big at MTV or Comedy Central. He’s one of the few people from that
              newspaper who decided it was time for him to take the show on the road and “make it” (whatever that means) in New York City by moving his whole life out there based on some spec freelance work and not much else.</p>
            <p name="397b" id="397b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Apparently since I was born — and lived — in New York City around the same time he was there trying to “make it” (whatever that means) some thought that would somehow translate
              into somehow us knowing each other. And honestly I didn’t know him from a hole in the ground but he seemed like a nice guy… At least from what I had heard about him. And in pictures that were shared with me he seemed like an innocuous,
              <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Devo</em>-loving Midwestern hipster.</p>
            <p name="40cc" id="40cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then I actually met him.</p>
            <p name="f596" id="f596" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ll leave a lot of the hyper-specific, niggly details of his personality for some other piece. But at the end of the day John was basically Midwestern passive aggressive weirdo
              writer wannabe at best who most of the time was really just an erudite hipster alcoholic and not much else.</p>
            <p name="a1e8" id="a1e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I mean, I was able to get along with him when I could. But the times his bitterness and resentment about failing as a New York City creative — and having to head back home to
              Madison, Wisconsin — popped up I could barely breathe in the same space he took up. Those were the times I suddenly became a target for some of his misguided, prejudicial self-centered bullshit.</p>
            <p name="6684" id="6684" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">So on to the rest of the story as I know it.</p>

          <div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn">
            <p name="4742" id="4742" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">While John was married, at one point he was separated from his wife.</p>
            <p name="f843" id="f843" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">His wife was nice, cute, cool and pleasant but was a tad robotic. She was kind of a hipster “Stepford Wife” in many respects. John was passive aggressive — and sometimes just
              straight out aggressive — and the drinking didn’t temper these tendencies. And oh yeah, while they were married they were supposedly in an “open relationship.” Which — as most of us who knew John knew — practically meant he just screwed
              around on her impulsively all the time and she simply sat at home alone and dealt with it.</p>
            <p name="1313" id="1313" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From what we could gather about their separation, she moved out of their apartment and was now sharing a place with some other guy on the other side of town. There was no
              romantic involvement with the other guy; he was just a roommate and that was that.</p>
            <p name="4d54" id="4d54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">John still lived in their old place — where he mainly sat around, drank and played PlayStation games when he was writing — and that was that.</p>

            <p name="b96c" id="b96c" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">While Madison, Wisconsin was a decent sized city, it was still a small town in many ways. And you would randomly run into people out on the street more often that you would
              elsewhere.</p>
            <p name="107f" id="107f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the case of John, I spotted him out on the street every now and then. Mostly at bars or just wandering about State Street. But during his separation from his wife, I would
              often see him hanging out at this bookstore right across the street from the newspaper’s offices.</p>
            <p name="64a0" id="64a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I knew he liked books — and there’s nothing wrong with liking books — but he would often be in that bookstore for hours on end just hanging out with the owner of the place.</p>
            <p name="62b6" id="62b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On a few occasions I witnessed some weirdness: Namely, the owner of the bookstore crossing the street to head to a nearby bar with John trailing behind him literally like some
              puppy dog. I mean the look on his face literally looked like a gobsmacked puppy — or a brainwashed cult member — when I spotted him trailing this guy. And don’t get me wrong, I would even attempt to say “Hi!” to him but it was like he
              was in some other mental state or just on some other planet altogether.</p>
            <p name="fc52" id="fc52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">More than a few times during this specific period he’d miss some weekly staff meetings while hanging out with that bookstore owner. His absence was noticed — and
              the staff would speak out about it — but since he was an old school staff writer they let these absences slide. And he would often show up near the end of a meeting — or sometimes even the next day — apologizing about missing a meeting
              but still somehow hand in his work work as assigned.</p>

          <div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn">
            <p name="04c6" id="04c6" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">While these absences were consistently sporadic, there was a small span of a week or two where literally nobody anywhere around town heard from John at all. Which was weird. He
              really didn’t have a job past writing for the newspaper — and the occasional shift at the local liquor store — so him just disappearing out of the blue like that was unexpected.</p>
            <p name="ef34" id="ef34" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Just as we were all on the edge of thinking something horrible happened to him — and even considered calling the police to report him as a missing person — he mysteriously showed
              up at the newspaper offices again.</p>
            <p name="a9b6" id="a9b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He sat down at the weekly meeting — a little bit after it started — and let us know what happened: He was picked up by local cops who were questioning him about the sudden and
              unexpected death of his wife’s roommate.</p>
            <p name="4cc8" id="4cc8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Without missing a beat John explained to us what happened: Apparently the his wife’s roommate died one night from a drinking a mixture of sleeping pills and alcohol and John was
              being questioned as a suspect. But while that was a description of a crime he was suspected of committing, that wasn’t the actual reason he was out of touch with us. That was simply something that happened while he was away doing
              something else.</p>
            <p name="285f" id="285f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">John’s story — to us and the cops — was that he went to some book fair with the owner of the bookshop he hung out at all the time during the exact period of time his wife’s
              roommate died. So apparently it was not possible for him to have been around when his wife’s roommate died.</p>
            <p name="e942" id="e942" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We knew John liked books, but he never told us about going to any book fairs. Nor did any of us — at the newspaper or the liquor store he worked at — knew that he took off for a
              few weeks to go to a book fair. I mean the guy — who was financially not in great shape to begin with — simply disappeared from two of his jobs… To go to a book fair? Weird.</p>
            <p name="ac6e" id="ac6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">But apparently the cops accepted that alibi, John was no longer a murder suspect — and that murder was now considered a suicide — and life went on.</p>

            <p name="9de9" id="9de9" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">A few weeks later John’s ex-wife moved back in with him. When I talked to her at some small gathering she repeated some variant of the same story John pushed on us and the cops:
              Her roommate was depressed and glum all the time she lived with him so the fact he suddenly just up and died like that didn’t surprise her.</p>
            <p name="5426" id="5426" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But it was hard to shake the impression — as she told me the story — that she was secretly, non-verbally stating, “And you believe that, right?”</p>
            <p name="5a66" id="5a66" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I didn’t really believe any of it to be completely honest. But I didn’t know what to say or how to say it or who to say it to or what difference it would make at that point. Who
              was I to judge? John and his wife were back together and her former roommate was dead and was that.</p>
