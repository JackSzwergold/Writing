            <p name="5896" id="5896" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Some friends of mine from P.S. 253 had a vacation home in Vermont. This was weird and kinda entitled in the 1970s since most — if not all — of the people who lived in
              Brighton Beach were poor, working class and were lucky enough to live a few blocks away from the beach let alone own a second vacation home out of state.</p>
            <p name="56d5" id="56d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The way I understood it is my friend’s parents both worked for the city — the mom was a social worker and the dad was a school guidance counselor — so they managed to know
              someone who knew someone who sold them a small vacation home in Vermont.</p>
            <p name="b8fd" id="b8fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anyway, sometime in 4th or 5th grade they invited me to visit them up in Vermont. It was a cool, kind and generous invitation extended to me and my city-kid life. But my parents
              were older and didn’t drive. Which meant it was up to my brother — who is 20 years older than me — to be my vacation partner.</p>
            <p name="e8cf" id="e8cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Truth be told, my brother wasn’t manifesting himself as a complete jerk at that time. But this trip would slowly reveal shades of his nasty side I had not really
              seen yet.</p>

            <p name="9000" id="9000" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">The trip up to Vermont was actually fun. Never went on a significant road trip until then and even driving past Bear Mountain in upstate New York was it’s own thrill.</p>
            <p name="998d" id="998d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We got to stop at cool rest stops and I marveled at the wood paneling and orange seats; they looked like a very “good” and well maintained McDonald’s but more WASPy. Never saw so
              many pickup trucks in nice shape as well as vending machines that sold smoking monkeys and other silly novelties as well. But like every trip with my brother I could never actually purchase anything I liked without a headache inducing
              fight.</p>
            <p name="ded2" id="ded2" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Why do you want this garbage?” he asked as I started to put money in the machine to get a smoking monkey. “Because I like it,” I responded and as I
              was about to shove some quarters into the machine he would grab me and say “There’s no time. We have to go.” And without that I would be literally dragged kicking and screaming away from the machine to the front door of the rest stop.
              “We can buy better toys when we get back,” he said which triggered it’s own unique anxiety in me. Nothing was worse than having my brother and his stupid wife — who hated mainstream mass-marketed toys and had a Bank Street College
              degree to assert her biases against mainstream mass-marketed toys — drag me to an “educational” toy store.</p>
            <p name="9729" id="9729" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">But that was neither here nor there since — thankfully — my brother was forgetful of unwanted promises like that and after a decent trip to Vermont he would
              definitely forget it. And soon enough we would be back on the road and headed up to Vermont.</p>

            <p name="c8e9" id="c8e9" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">When we got to my friend’s place it was cool and comfortable. It was a humble little house; not exactly a shack, but not exactly a mansion either. Just a basic and rustic little
              two story structure and near a stream.</p>
            <p name="ef7e" id="ef7e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We spent days doing tons of useful nothing things like exploring the woods or rummaging through a small junkyard filled with old glass and rusty metal stuff. There was even the
              rusted out shell of a car sitting nearby. It was covered with weeds and vines, but still had seat springs and a steering wheel in place.</p>
            <p name="16d1" id="16d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Unfortunately we couldn’t get that rusty car out of the junkyard to bring it back to the cabin, so we had to do other things to bide our lazy summer childhood time
              during the summer. Like going fishing.</p>

            <p name="5a54" id="5a54" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Much like a lot of my city childhood memories, fishing wasn’t anything city kids really did. When it came to fishing, I mainly saw middle-aged to older guys either fishing on the
              rocks of beach in Brighton Beach or fishing off of the pier near the parachute jump in Coney Island. The only time I ever saw kids fishing were in TV shows like “The Andy Griffith Show” or old Little Rascals reruns and stuff like that.
            </p>
            <p name="bffb" id="bffb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So this whole “gone fishing” thing was a learning experience for me.</p>
            <p name="a62f" id="a62f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">First — and most importantly — this was a “no adults” outing. Which was great! We simply — and pretty impulsively — grabbed some fishing poles from the closet, grabbed a pocket
              knife, and headed down the country road near us to the nearby lake.</p>
            <p name="c03c" id="c03c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We passed by some fields with old fashioned stake and wire fences and cows behind them. Don’t know if they were working farms, but the cows were cool. After a while — just about
              when the walk was getting boring, tedious and tiresome — we arrived in town.</p>
            <p name="e7bf" id="e7bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This “town” consisted of a strip of maybe six to seven buildings at most. Only a few of them were shops of any kind. I mainly remember a gas station, general store and maybe a
              junk store of some kind mixed in there. Even as a kid I knew this town was clearly fading away, if it ever shone at all. But was not a complete tourist trap or discarded memory yet so it was a comfortable sort of limbo to meander
              around.</p>
            <p name="971d" id="971d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We walked into the general store and asked about worms. The guy behind the counter pointed to the cooler case in front of the register. Asking about worms was weird enough, but
              it blew my city kid’s mind when I peered into to cooler case: Right there — next to the ice cream and cups of ice — were small styrofoam cups filled with dirt and worms. The cups were covered in some kind of plastic wrap (with air holes
              punched) and that was held in place with a rubber band. Nothing fancy; just cups of cooler chilled worms up for sale.</p>
            <p name="5fe0" id="5fe0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">We opened up the cooler, randomly picked a cup of worms, paid he guy for the works and just walked over to the lake.</p>

          <div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn">
            <p name="c5d8" id="c5d8" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">It was a bright and sunny day; not too warm and not too hot with just enough of a breeze to cool you off every now and the. We sat down near the paved edge of the lake, opened up
              the cup of worms and grabbed one lucky worm who had the honor to be the first worm to be used as fishing bait.</p>
            <p name="be71" id="be71" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You do it,” my friend said when it came time to put one on the hook. “What?” I responded, “I never did that before.”</p>
            <p name="71ab" id="71ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I grabbed the hook on my pole’s line, grabbed a worm and looked at it. “Now what?” I said and shrugged as he told me I had to poke the worm through the hook. “Really?” I said
              and “Yes!” he responded. I looked at the dirt covered slimy worm in my right hand and hook in my left hand and paused. Just as I was about to pierce the worm through the hook my friend stopped me and said, “Wait! We should cut it in
              half.”</p>
            <p name="f427" id="f427" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">His reasoning was we were two people fishing and the cup only had so many worms. So if we cut them in half we’d have twice as many worms.</p>
            <p name="b869" id="b869" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So with that he pulled out his pocket knife and I put the worm down on the cement.</p>
            <p name="c5b8" id="c5b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It writhed around a bit and I said, “Okay, cut him.” But my friend chickened out and handed me the knife. “You do it,” he said. And I guess that became my job for the day.</p>
            <p name="c4b6" id="c4b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I looked at the knife and — like all kids pocket knives — the blade was kinda shiny but still looked dull; I guess pocket knife manufacturers didn’t want kids stabbing each
              other. That said, in took the knife in my hand, held onto the worm, pressed that dull knife as hard as I could onto it, and sliced it in half. “Ewww,” my friend said as I took a squirming half of the worm in my hand and poked it through
              the hook. With that I stood up, positioned the pole behind me and flung the weighted hook into the lake.</p>
            <p name="5ac0" id="5ac0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My line landed in the lake, and the floater bobbed a bit as it settled. My friend did the same thing with the other half of the worm and his pole.</p>
            <p name="40aa" id="40aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Soon enough both of our lines were in the water and we both just sat and waited for the floaters to twitch a bit indicating that a fish bit the hook and we caught one.</p>
            <p name="97c7" id="97c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I held onto my pole for a bit and then just let it sit on the edge of the lake as we waited.</p>
            <p name="ae81" id="ae81" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I stood up and looked into the water. It wasn’t exactly clear or murky; just cloudy and a bit brackish. You could see various shapes move back and forth, but never enough to know
              what you were looking at. At some point something breached the water to grab a fly or something it saw on the surface: It was a catfish.</p>
            <p name="5748" id="5748" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Are we going to just catch a catfish?” I asked and my friend just shrugged. I mean catfish are cool, but they are no grand prize. Soon his line was
              twitching. He grabbed his pole, stood up and started to pull it in; I crouched near the edge of the lake waiting to see what he’d pull in. After a few minutes of reeling and pulling I could see it: It was a big, brown, greasy catfish.
            </p>
            <p name="7014" id="7014" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I grabbed the line and pulled it up onto the shore. It twitched and gasped for air as it laid on the concrete slab near the edge of the lake.</p>
            <p name="0c43" id="0c43" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Ugh. I don’t want it,” my friend said. “Pull the hook out and toss it back,” he added. And with that, I carefully grabbed the catfish, making sure
              not to get my hands too close to the sharp quills around it’s head, and pulled the hook out and tossed it back in the lake. I watched as it flopped a bit in the water and then made a beeline away from us.</p>
            <p name="b8f9" id="b8f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My hands were all slimed up from handling the catfish, so I wiped them on my jeans and before I knew it, my line was twitching. I went to grab the pole and managed to grab it
              just before the whole thing fell in lake.</p>
            <p name="1608" id="1608" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Whoa!” I said as I pulled the pole up and started to reel it in. Whatever it was it flapped a bit and breached the water in the distance. We both
              could see it was not a catfish; it was some kind of “normal” fish.</p>
            <p name="baa5" id="baa5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I pulled it in some more and then reeled it up out of the water: It was a rainbow trout! We we both kind of stunned; this was my first time fishing and my first catch and it was
              something genuinely cool.</p>
            <p name="1acc" id="1acc" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“That’s amazing!” My friend said as I put it on the hot concrete at the edge of the lake, removed the hook and held it in my hand. It was slimy and
              “fishy” like a fish should be, but it had scales so I could get a better grip on it.</p>
            <p name="0f12" id="0f12" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My friend found a paper bag nearby, and I tossed the flopping fish inside of it.</p>
            <p name="b0dc" id="b0dc" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing">“Let’s go home,” I said and with that we packed up our gear and headed back to his family’s summer home.</p>

            <p name="e3fe" id="e3fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">That said, I looked at it on the counter and wondered what to do with it. My friend’s dad said he would wrap it in plastic and put it in the fridge which made
              sense to me so that’s what we did and we called it a night.</p>

            <p name="fb2f" id="fb2f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So we got all of our stuff, brought it downstairs and started to pack it into his car when I remembered the fish. I ran into the house and my brother sniped at me “Don’t worry!
              It’s no big deal!” I ignored his passive aggressive shouts, headed to the refrigerator and pulled out the plastic wrapped rainbow trout.</p>
            <p name="08d2" id="08d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As I held the fish and headed outside, I realized how hot it was outside and how cool the fish felt as I held onto it.</p>
            <p name="7224" id="7224" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“How can we keep it cool on the ride back?” I said as I walked to my brother. My friend’s dad said, “Don’t worry, I’ll get some ice,” and before he
              could even turn around to head into the house, my brother shouts, “No!!!” Everyone stopped to look at him and wondered what he meant. I mean ice is ice and ice can keep things cool, so what’s the big deal? I tentatively asked, “So how
              are we going to keep the fish fresh?” to which my brother mumbled a bit and pulled some aluminum foil out of the trunk of his car, walked over to me and said, “Give me the fish!” Feeling so bit unsure, but not knowing what else to do, I
              handed him the fish.</p>
            <p name="5e40" id="5e40" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He proceeded to wrap it in aluminum foil, then put it in a towel and unceremoniously plop it in the trunk of the car.</p>
            <p name="322d" id="322d" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing">“No!” I screamed. “What about the ice?” I added. “Don’t worry,” he said. “It would all be fine,” he added. But I was still concerned.
              Even my friend’s dad asked, “You sure you don’t want any ice?” To which my brother shouted, “No!” And then looked at me and said, “Let’s go.” And with that I said my goodbyes to my friend and their family, got into the car and headed
              home.</p>

              outside the building. They waved at us and I waved back. I was happy to see them.</p>
            <p name="62c7" id="62c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My dad walked over to the car just as we were getting out. “Did you have a good time?” he asked as I ran over to hug him and I said, “Yes!” I enthusiastically told him about the
              fish I caught. “Really?” he said, and I said “Yes!” again as I ran to the trunk of the car to get it and show it to him.</p>
            <p name="950e" id="950e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As my brother opened it up on that hot summer day, the stench of rotting fish soaked the air. “No!!!” I screamed, “It’s rotted!!!” I added as I grabbed the towel wrapped fish and
              started to unwrap it. With towel off the smell just got stronger and as I looked through the plastic wrap, it just looked as disgusting as it smelled; it wasn’t a cool catch of a fish anymore but just a piece of rancid, rotten garbage.
              A corpse of a fish you would bury in the ground as fertilizer.</p>
            <p name="14ab" id="14ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I stood there and started to cry, “Why didn’t you take the ice?!?” and my brother just dismissively responded, “It’s no big deal.” My dad put his hand on my shoulder, squeezed
              and started yelling at my brother in Polish, Hebrew and maybe Yiddish. No idea what language it was but it was one of those fights they had in front of me in another language as if that would protect me. As if humans barking in words
              that I didn’t understand would somehow spare me the trauma of the fight happening to begin with.</p>
            <p name="f6a0" id="f6a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Soon, my dad and brother stopped fighting and I walked with my dad back to our building. As we walked the short distance, I held onto that disgusting pile of heat rotted fish as
              if it were gold. Just as we go to the front door, my dad said we should throw it out. I resisted the idea initially but with my brother still tending to his car behind us and my dad next to me it seemed to make sense: The fish was in
              nasty shape to say the least and if we brought it inside of the apartment it would stink up the place. The catch was a fond memory and this rotting fish was just a painful corpse of nostalgia at this point.</p>
            <p name="391a" id="391a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So with that we walked to the building’s garbage cans, opened one of them up and tossed it in.</p>
            <p name="95e6" id="95e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We walked back to the front of the building, and my brother was there to say goodbye. He bent down near me and asked, “So you had fun?” and I nodded politely; not only did he not
              take ownership for the fish rotting into garbage, he was not willing to mention how by doing so he ruined my first fishing catch of my life. Remember, this is the behavior of someone who is 20 years older than me.</p>
            <p name="0f07" id="0f07" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He gently tapped me with a “We’re cool, right?” tap on my shoulder, stood up and said goodbye to my dad and headed back to his car to head back to his home in Washington Heights.
            </p>
            <p name="7bc9" id="7bc9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was happy to see him drive off; the tension of his presence slipped away as the car sped off in the distance.</p>
            <p name="83ce" id="83ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I went upstairs to put my all my stuff back and then headed outside to play a bit with neighborhood kids. I told them about the fish I caught, but with nothing to
              show it was just at story at that point.</p>
