            <p name="f860" id="f860" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">It was the fall of 1981 and I was flipping through the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Daily News</em> one Sunday when I saw it: An ad for some kinda of “CityKids”
              Atari-related contest happening at the main Macy’s flagship location at 34th Street in Manhattan. And according to the ad, there were prizes to be won! The first prize was an Atari 400 and the second prize was the new Atari <em
                class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em> game for the Atari home computers.</p>
            <p name="3dc2" id="3dc2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My jaw dropped: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em> was a really popular arcade game, and the release of a home computer version was pretty exciting. Besides, I
              barely had my Atari 400 for a year and was already bored with playing the few pirated games I had.</p>
            <p name="5a25" id="5a25" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I got up off the floor, ran over to the living room showed the ad to my dad who smiled and basically said — as enthusiastically as he could about a video game didn’t care
              about — “That’s nice!” And without any deep negotiation, he agreed to take me to the contest when it happened.</p>
            <p name="5d75" id="5d75" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Damn was I psyched about <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em>! And I was really excited to share the news of this contest with friends at school.</p>

            <p name="32a2" id="32a2" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Back at school — while yammering about nonsense with some classmates — I mentioned the Atari Centipede contest at Macy’s and how I was going to enter it. There was silence,
              followed by a pregnant pause and then someone just blurted “So what?” But I didn’t let that discourage me and responded, “Well, I’m good at playing video games… So I can win!” Then there was another pregnant pause and someone asked,
              “But what if you win the Atari 400. You already have one?” Everyone nodded and I responded, “Well, I could sell it.” And this seemingly endless juvenile game of “Knock him down…” basically went on and on for a while until class started.

            <p name="2661" id="2661" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Back in the classroom of whatever junior high school class I was in at that moment, I sat at my desk and stared at the dated blank page in my notebook and started
              to wonder, “Maybe they have something. I never really played <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em> more than a few times. How can I win a contest like that if I don’t practice?”</p>

            <p name="bb32" id="bb32" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">So after on my way home from school I went to Captain’s Quarters — a local neighborhood arcade — and decided to play a few rounds of <em
                class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em> and see how good I was at the game.</p>
            <p name="8769" id="8769" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Captain’s Quarters was something you don’t see anymore: It was a huge storefront arcade on Brighton Beach Avenue near Coney Island Avenue. As an adult it’s clear to me there had
              to be some shady stuff happening in there — and it might have been a front for someone or something — but I didn’t care. It was an arcade that had tons of games, was well maintained and was located conveniently near me; smack dab in the
              middle of a stretch of street that was otherwise filled with junk stores, fruit stands and the semi-viable small businesses that typically line the streets of a poor neighborhood.</p>
            <p name="d6c1" id="d6c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I stepped inside the place, I walked over to the change machine, stuck my dollar into the slot, gathered up the four quarters it spit back out into the tray, walked over to
              the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em> machine and started to play.</p>
            <p name="6bb4" id="6bb4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And within less than a minute the truth was clear as day: I kinda sucked at <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em>. My second round on the game was slightly better,
              but it felt like a chore more than a fun thing to do. And by the time I was on my third game, the game wasn’t fun to play at all.</p>
            <p name="bc89" id="bc89" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The graphics were cool and the game seemed like it would be fun, but the trackball that the game used as a main controller was awkward to use. And I also started to realize
              something: A video game for a home computer system wouldn’t use a trackball anyway. It would use that standard black Atari joystick. So practicing on the arcade version of the game wouldn’t really help me practice for this contest.</p>
            <p name="7246" id="7246" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Which is all to say that by the time I lost my last player on that third game of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em>, I just joylessly stared at the screen for a
              second or two, picked up my schoolbag and headed back home.</p>
            <p name="f0e0" id="f0e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">When I got home I started to think about how I could practice for the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em> contest. None of the games I had at home
              resembled <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em> in any way but I had to think of some way to practice so I could get ready for the official contest.</p>

            <p name="11f3" id="11f3" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">When the weekend hit, I decided to head over to the Computer Center on 32nd Street in Manhattan to browse their wares when I noticed something right when I stepped in the front
              door: They had an Atari 800 set up to demo a “hot” new game they had called: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Megalegs</em>.</p>
            <p name="93f5" id="93f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I walked over to the well organized — but ultimately simple display — and watched as one of the guys from the store played the game. Holy shit, it <em
                class="markup--em markup--p-em">Megalegs</em> was a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em> knock-off game!</p>
            <p name="e7c5" id="e7c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The graphics were colorful and cool — and honestly not as good as the arcade version of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em> — but the actual gameplay seemed 100%
              the same as <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em>.</p>
            <p name="6572" id="6572" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I stood there and watched the guy from the store play the game, and after he finished playing the game I asked if I could try it out. “Sure,” he said as he stepped aside and
              passed the joystick over to me, hit the “Start” button on the Atari 800 and the game began.</p>
            <p name="ce3d" id="ce3d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Although I was just as bad at <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Megalegs</em> as I was at the arcade version of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em>, I still felt
              like I could learn how to get better at playing the game when I used a joystick instead of a trackball.</p>
            <p name="1545" id="1545" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After my game was over, I stepped aside, picked up the ziplocked bag that had the game in it and looked it over. The cover art was goofy and pretty cool. And it was available on
              cassette which is what I needed since I didn’t have a disk drive at that point anyway. But past any of that, what I noticed right away was the price: $29.99 or something like that. Whatever it cost, I definitely could not buy it right
              then and there.</p>
            <p name="c098" id="c098" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“So you want to buy it?” the guy asked me to which I responded, “Yeah, but I don’t have enough money on me.”</p>
            <p name="e73d" id="e73d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">With that he smiled, nodded and handed me a promotional flyer for the game. I said, “Thank you…” looked it over, folded it up, shoved it in my jacket pocket and
              headed back to the subway to head home.</p>

            <p name="035d" id="035d" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">When I got to my building, I headed upstairs and my dad immediately asked me if I wanted anything to eat, “Sure.” I said as I headed back into my room.</p>
            <p name="7c49" id="7c49" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I took off my jacket, pulled out the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Megalegs</em> flyer and looked it over again. Since I was merely a kid with a basic allowance, I had just
              about $8 saved up at the time. Should I hit up my dad for the rest of the money I needed to get <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Megalegs</em>? I dunno.</p>
            <p name="49d3" id="49d3" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“What’s that?” my dad said as he brought a plate of food to my room. “It’s a new game,” I said as I passed the flyer over to him to check out. He
              looked it over and said, “$29? That’s expensive!” I simply shrugged in response and left it at that.</p>
            <p name="f105" id="f105" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m pretty sure my dad expected me to ask him for money to buy the game, but I didn’t. Saving up money was not a strong point for me at that time. And I definitely hit him up for
              advances on my allowance a lot already during the summer. So I knew that was a losing proposition at best.</p>
            <p name="8dcb" id="8dcb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">So we both silently acknowledged not much about me needing the money for <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Megalegs</em> and let the whole situation pass for
              now.</p>

            <p name="8f76" id="8f76" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">When Monday came, I headed into school I showed the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Megalegs</em>flyer to some friends. “I need to practice with this other game if I want to
              win that <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em> contest,” I said. And they agreed as they looked over the flyer.</p>
            <p name="e058" id="e058" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“That game looks cool!” said one friend who had an Atari 800. “How about this: Let’s go 50/50 on the game,” he said. “What do you mean?” I asked.
              “Well, I pay $15 and you pay $15 and we can copy the game anyway so just let me have a copy.”</p>
            <p name="a82f" id="a82f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That was a pretty good idea! We all just discovered how to pirate Atari program cassettes using an improvised audio dubbing cable. So if we went in 50/50 on the cost of a game
              like that, one of us could keep the original game and just make a copy to give to the other person.</p>
            <p name="229b" id="229b" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Okay, but I get to keep the original cassette and packaging,” I said. “Fine with me!” he said.</p>

            <p name="5d68" id="5d68" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The subway trip from the ass end of Brooklyn to 34th Street in Manhattan went as it always went. Lots of waiting. Lots of sitting around and doing not much of anything. Brief
              excitement as the train emerged from the tunnel and headed over the Manhattan Bridge and, finally, we arrived at 34th Street-Herald Square: The home of Macy’s!</p>
            <p name="1947" id="1947" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We headed into Macy’s and started to look around for the contest. The ad clearly said what floor it was on, but Macy’s — like most massive retail stores — was a huge, confusing
              place.</p>
            <p name="d5dc" id="d5dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After checking out some signage and asking around we made our way up the home electronics floor. We passed by this place tons of times — and even checked out the video game
              displays they had in the past — but this contest was not on the main part of the home electronics floor. Rather it was in a small beige and boring conference-like room near the end of the floor.</p>
            <p name="3485" id="3485" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And by “beige” I mean that as a feeling and aesthetic reality. The room was as drab, beige, neutral and non-festive as a 1980s conference room could be. Some chairs were stacked
              away on the sides of the room and there were a few Atari posters on the walls — as well as a few balloons — to decorate the place. But right near the front of the room was, presumably, where this contest was going to happen. It was a
              set up with a few Atari computers lined up across a table and a basic projection TV projecting the game onto a screen right up front.</p>
            <p name="7803" id="7803" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some people from Atari, noticed us standing around and looking so they came up to us and asked us if we were there for the contest. I enthusiastically responded “Yes!” and they
              immediately looked us over as if we were some misfit freaks. While I was 14 at the time, my dad was 63 and we didn’t exactly look like some WASPy Norman Rockwell family unit. We didn’t look like father and son as much as grandfather and
              grandchild. “Okay, well here let me write down your name,” and with that the guy wrote down my name on some list of contest entrants. I looked at the list as he wrote and it was small, but clearly had a few other entrants on it. They
              asked us what borough we were from and I could clearly see I was the only kid from Brooklyn; everyone else was from Manhattan.</p>
            <p name="498b" id="498b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My dad and I meandered around the conference room for a bit and — after a while — I asked if we could play the game. “Sure,” the guy said as he handed me a joystick.</p>
            <p name="22dc" id="22dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This was the first time I was playing the actual home computer version of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em> and not that <em
                class="markup--em markup--p-em">Megalegs</em> knock-off I had at home so I was a bit nervous.</p>
            <p name="61b3" id="61b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was doing well at first, but not great. It was then I realized that my “brilliant” idea that I could somehow practice by playing <em
                class="markup--em markup--p-em">Megalegs</em> was clearly not a great plan. The gameplay and patterns were clearly different despite the games visually looking similar. It never occurred to me as a kid that different programmers would
              use different patterns and algorithms; but it didn’t matter. I was doing pretty well at the time.</p>
            <p name="28f1" id="28f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As I was playing, some kid came in — presumably one of the kids I would be up against — and watched me play. “Wow!” he said. “You’re pretty good,” he added.</p>
            <p name="7c26" id="7c26" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Yeah,” I said to him while still in the middle of playing. “I’ve been practicing at home,” I added.</p>
            <p name="1041" id="1041" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The kid gasped and said, “You cheated!” since most anyone who followed home computer video game releases knew that <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em>was not
              available to the public yet.</p>
            <p name="3dc8" id="3dc8" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“No I didn’t,” I explained. “There is this other game called <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Megalegs</em>that’s like <em
                class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em>. I practiced by playing that.” And with that he nodded and walked over to talk to some of his friends about what I just talked to him about.</p>
            <p name="f93d" id="f93d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I finished playing my practice game and — to my own surprised — scored a pretty solid high score. The guy from Atari who was running the contest came over and said, “Wow! You’re
              sure to win now!” just as my dad came by and asked, “You did good?” I pointed to the screen and showed him my score. “Wow! That’s pretty good,” he said as if he actually knew what a high score in <em
                class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em> might be. But no matter… He was being positive and supportive and that’s all I really needed.</p>
            <p name="89db" id="89db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As I stepped away, the kids who I was up against came up to the Atari computer that was demoing the game and started to fiddle around with it.</p>
            <p name="3040" id="3040" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of them opened up the Atari’s cartridge slot cover to see if they could see the actual <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em> cartridge in it… But there was no
              cartridge there! I walked over as the kids quickly closed the slot cover and the computer booted up to the default “Atari Computer Memo Pad” application.</p>
            <p name="08bc" id="08bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A woman from the Atari team came by to see if she could fix things. She looked around the computer and asked someone else for help and was clearly a bit panicked. But I could see
              what she was trying to do: She was trying to load the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em> game from the external Atari 410 cassette drive. I guess the official <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em> game
              cartridges weren’t manufactured yet, so this contest would be running the game from a cassette tape version instead.</p>
            <p name="f622" id="f622" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I walked over and said, “I can help!” And with that switched off the computer, held down the “Start” key, waited for a beep and then hit the “Return” key and the program started
              loading again. The benefit of having a crappy Atari 410 cassette drive at home was that I at least knew how to use it.</p>
            <p name="7a26" id="7a26" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I have one at home,” I told the woman from Atari. She smiled as the other guy running the thing came over, saw what was happening and said, “Yeah,
              the kid fixed it. We just have to wait now.” He looked at me, looked at her, then they both smiled, shrugged and walked away.</p>
            <p name="74e7" id="74e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After a while <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em> loaded and the guy running the competition asked us all to come up front and said the competition would be
              starting. And we would each take turns playing one game of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em> based on the order we signed in.</p>
            <p name="9891" id="9891" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I knew I wasn’t at the top of the list, so I wasn’t going to be the first to play. But I checked the list and there wasn’t more than one or two other people signed up after me so
              it was a small group of competitors at best.</p>
            <p name="b43f" id="b43f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I watched as the other kids played. They did well, but nowhere near my score. Then one kid started playing and easily blew my practice score away. I was worried, but tried to be
              calm about it.</p>
            <p name="b4c4" id="b4c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Soon it was my turn. I did pretty well despite my palms being incredibly sweaty from being nervous and my hands shaking a bit from the stress of being the center of attention in
              this small, dingy conference room.</p>
            <p name="e1e3" id="e1e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But when the digital dust of my game settled my score was high, but not high enough. It was lower than my practice score and lower than that of the other kids, but it was still a
              pretty high score.</p>
            <p name="380d" id="380d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The next kid came up to play and truly bombed hard. I barely think he successfully shot anything at all when I think of it. And the last kid on the list was nowhere to be found.
              So when all was said and done, the contest was over and I was in second place! It wasn’t first place, but hey… I won something by doing something!</p>
            <p name="70e1" id="70e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After the results were announced, the Atari folks had me pose with the winner. It was an awkward photo at best since I was the only kid there that looked like a scrappy, greasy
              little street kid even when I was cleaned up as best as I could be cleaned up. The other kids were basically WASPy kids from either the Upper East Side or Upper West Side and seemed to have matching Izod Lacoste polo shirts on while I
              was decked out in my best, non-branded second hand, working-class kid clothes.</p>
            <p name="4556" id="4556" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As the Atari guy got ready to take our picture, I held up two fingers on my right hand in a “V for Victory” salute and the guy — who was taking pictures with a Polaroid — said
              something like “Cool! Two fingers! For second place? Nice!”</p>
            <p name="a9ca" id="a9ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Was a bit pissed about him interpreting my “V for Victory” salute as meaning “Two for Second Place” but who cared. The contest was over and I was notable for my achievement.</p>
            <p name="6a4c" id="6a4c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Atari guy asked us for a mailing address and phone number so they could send me a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em> cartridge in the mail. While I had to
              wait about 4 to 6 weeks to get the cartridge, I automatically got a dark green <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em> t-shirt that day just for participating as well as a copy of Kraftwerk’s “Computer World” on LP as well.
              He also passed along his business card as part of the whole package as well; technically this was the first time anyone gave me their business card so I was proud of that in my own way.</p>
            <p name="896c" id="896c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Just as we finished up and planned to head home, some people dressed as Pac-Man and a red ghost showed up to be a part of a small promotional “parade” that was going to wind it’s
              way through the store. In my delusional enthusiasm at my winning second place at the competition I thought the parade was for us kids and we could march along with them.</p>
            <p name="3331" id="3331" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So me and my dad tagged along as Pac-Man and the red ghost meandered around Macy’s that afternoon. What a dysfunctional sight that must of been to shoppers shopping for dress
              shirts and kitchen gear at the time!</p>
            <p name="a3e7" id="a3e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">After a while — just when it started to feel genuinely awkward and weird — me and my dad peeled ourselves away from the sad little Pac-Man parade, headed down the
              escalators and headed back to the subway station to head home.</p>

              and without a beat he simply said, “Who cares?” and then I explained the prize I won was a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em> cartridge and he said, “Okay…” and then with that I just said goodbye, hung up the phone and
              headed down into the subway station to head back home.</p>

            <p name="4856" id="4856" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">About 6-ish weeks later — the higher side of the 4 to 6 week estimate — I asked my dad if anything came in the mail for me from Atari. “No,” he said as I went back into my room.
            </p>
            <p name="ced6" id="ced6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since 6-ish weeks had clearly passed and I still didn’t get that <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em> cartridge in the mail I pulled out the business card the Atari
              guy gave me at the competition and called him up. It was around 4:00pm on a weekday and he was a bit tired sounding on his side of the phone.</p>
            <p name="3375" id="3375" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“What?” the guy asked. “I was in that <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em> contest at Macy’s, got in second place and I still haven’t
              got the cartridge in the mail.” “What’s your name?” he asked as he shuffled through some papers. I told him my name, he read off my address, I confirmed the address was correct and he said he would send it off today.</p>
            <p name="2bfa" id="2bfa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A few days later the cartridge showed up in the mail. The packaging was crushed since it just shoved it in a plain manilla envelope instead of a box, but the game cartridge was
              still good despite the package being smashed.</p>
            <p name="2a68" id="2a68" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I popped it in my Atari 400 and started to play it. I was definitely fun, but it was honestly nowhere near as fun as <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Megalegs</em> was. The
              truth was I had played <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Megalegs</em> so much since getting it the official <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em> game for the Atari home computers seemed relatively sluggish in
              comparison.</p>
            <p name="716f" id="716f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">So after a while, the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Centipede</em> cartridge and smashed box just ended up in my closet since I ended up playing <em
                class="markup--em markup--p-em">Megalegs</em> more often. I still liked the t-shirt — and wore it with pride to school — although I never really got into Kraftwerk’s “Computer World” at the time.</p>
