            <p name="b28d" id="b28d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">My parents both worked factory jobs at different times of their lives in the family and never really talked much about it. Kinda typical for any working class family I
              guess; forget the past and keep on moving forward to some kind of better future.</p>
            <p name="33b9" id="33b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That said, my earliest memory of my parent’s working life was as a kid in the 1970s and getting up early around the same time as my dad to eat breakfast and get ready to go to
              elementary school. In my dad’s case, he was going to work at a box factory in Williamsburg. In my case, I’d simply watch TV before going to school.</p>
            <p name="3506" id="3506" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">TV back then consisted mostly of an endless stream of “The Little Rascals” reruns and whatever random cartoon cavalcade program channels 5, 9 and 11 might have had on at the
              time. Which was fine by me!</p>
            <p name="878b" id="878b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For whatever reason my parents really didn’t turn on any house lights past the basics early in the morning. So it was always a tad dark in the apartment. Only the blue glow of
              the black and white TV in the living room mixed with the light of one lone table lamp in the living room and kitchen would mix with small blobs of sunlight that would leak through the edges of the window shade at dawn.</p>
            <p name="b81f" id="b81f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I remember sitting on my mom’s lap and eating cereal — and maybe a banana if we had one — as we both watched TV. At some point my dad would come into the living room, and say
              something to my mom — in English, Polish, Yiddish or some mix of them — and then I would get a kiss on the cheek goodbye from him as my mom set me down on the couch to eat and watch TV alone.</p>
            <p name="aa05" id="aa05" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I sat on the couch as my mom and dad went to the front door, my mom bid my dad farewell and then locked the apartment door and headed back to the living room.</p>
            <p name="bdd6" id="bdd6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then it was my turn to finish up eating, wash up, get dressed, get ready and head off to school.</p>
            <p name="73c5" id="73c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I was younger, my mom would walk me to school. When I got older, I happily braved the streets on my own.</p>
            <p name="73cf" id="73cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Whatever anyone wants to say about NYC in the 1970s, I always found walking in the streets early in the morning to be fun. It was always quieter than anytime later
              in the day yet always busy in it’s own way with newspapers, groceries and other stuff being delivered to local shops while kids like me headed off to school, and adults headed off to wherever.</p>

            <p name="c92d" id="c92d" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">About a decade later I was in high school. Lincoln High school to be specific which was about 4 blocks away from where I lived. So outside of playing video games or grabbing a
              slice of pizza with friends after school, I was usually home by 4:00pm tops on most days.</p>
            <p name="35c2" id="35c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A lot of times when I came home, my dad would be in my room and looking out the window at the subway station platform. My dad wasn’t working at that point in his life. At some
              point during the mid 1970s, my dad suffered a heart attack and had to quit his job at the box factory because of it. That’s when my mom took over the job of being the one in the family to have a job that could support the family.</p>
            <p name="e1b9" id="e1b9" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“How was your day?” he would usually ask me, and I would usually respond, “Fine…” as I dropped my book bag down on my desk and settled into the post
              school day.</p>
            <p name="5e69" id="5e69" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Do you want anything to eat?” he’d ask and I would usually say, “Yes…” and then he would head out of my room, down the hallway and into the kitchen.
            </p>
            <p name="587d" id="587d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Depending on my mood, I would either play video games, read magazines, listen to music, or all of the above. And sometimes I would do homework, but I would delay that as much as
              possible.</p>
            <p name="4b2f" id="4b2f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since you could easily hear subway trains from our apartment, my dad would pop in and out of my room anytime he heard one rumble down the tracks and screech into the station.</p>
            <p name="f0f4" id="f0f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He was waiting for my mom to get home. And she always made sure to wave at us when she got off the train and headed down the stairs to head home. Sometimes we could see her on
              the subway platform. Other times, we could see her from the staircase area just below the tracks. But in general, he popped in an out of my room mainly to wave at her and see her wave at him.</p>
            <p name="0c5e" id="0c5e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Soon enough he spotted her and food was ready for me. We knew that in about 10 to 15 minutes she would be back home… Unless she had the urge to head over to Met Foods, the bakery
              or the jeweler down the block or felt like gossiping with the Yentas in front of the building… But for the most part, the second we saw her at the subway station we knew she would be home pretty soon.</p>
            <p name="eade" id="eade" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When she came home, she’d greet us all, drop all of her stuff off in the bedroom and then eat something as well. We never really ate formally around a table as a family like some
              bullshit Norman Rockwell painting. But we generally ate at the same time… And sometimes in the same general vicinity if we were all watching something on TV.</p>
            <p name="81a2" id="81a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She’d then take a bath or shower, head to bed or maybe even head outside to gossip some more with the Yentas if the night was nice enough.</p>
            <p name="53c3" id="53c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But by the time 10:00pm came around, she and my dad would basically be in bed and I might still be up with the door to my room locked and I would be up until I felt tired enough
              to conk out for the night as well.</p>
            <p name="3f66" id="3f66" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">And then all that would happen again — the same way but slightly different — the next day.</p>
