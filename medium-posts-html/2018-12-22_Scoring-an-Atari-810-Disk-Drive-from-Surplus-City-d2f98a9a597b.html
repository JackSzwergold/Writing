              <figcaption class="imageCaption">An Atari 810 disk drive powering up. (Photo by Jack Szwergold; Taken December 22, 2018)</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p name="3587" id="3587" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I was 13 or 14 and had an Atari 400 home computer I got for my Bar Mitzvah. That computer was a mixed bag of a gift if I there ever was one. While I liked the fact that I
              could play video games on it, the gift — which was ostensibly from the “whole family” but in reality from my brother and his overbearing wife at time — was loaded with expectations of use that I could not fulfill. Instead of playing
              games all day, my brother and his wife expected me to be an instantaneous programming genius who wrote video games instead of mindlessly playing them.</p>
            <p name="8309" id="8309" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While I became a programmer as an adult, at the time I was just 13 or 14 years old and all I wanted to do was play video games, not make them. But software — especially video
              games — cost too much back then. And besides that, owning a computer like an Atari 400 in the early 1980s was a “rich kid” thing; and my family was far from rich. So I made due with the small handful of games I got as part of the Bar
              Mitzvah gift package to entertain myself.</p>
            <p name="3948" id="3948" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That is until I learned how to pirate software.</p>
            <p name="b620" id="b620" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I might have only had a measly Atari 410 cassette tape drive at the time, but pirating was a fairly easy skill to pick up. All one had to do was figure out how to make an exact
              copy of a cassette tape and you were good to go! In my case I figured out how to connect two portable radios with cassette decks via an improvised dubbing cable made from the salvaged cables of two busted 3.5mm stereo headphones.</p>
            <p name="1553" id="1553" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While from a quality standpoint the cable was crap — and literally held together with cheap Scotch tape and not much else — it did the job. If someone I knew had a cool game on a
              cassette tape, all I needed to do to get a copy of that that game was to get a blank cassette tape, borrow a friend’s cassette deck to hook up to mine with that cable, hit play on one deck, record on the other and some time later I
              would have my own copy of that game.</p>
            <p name="1674" id="1674" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And that description makes the dubbing process sound simple. And to be completely honest dubbing tapes of any kind — audio or data — is, indeed, a simple process. But dubbing
              tapes in real-time is also a very tedious — and time consuming — process.</p>
            <p name="df73" id="df73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Depending on how large — from a raw data standpoint — the game was, dubbing cassette tapes could take a lot of time to do. And borrowing a friend’s cassette recorder was often a
              small political battle in and of itself since they would often want a copy of the game as well, thus doubling the amount of time I would have to spend making a copy of a game.</p>
            <p name="676a" id="676a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the end of the day, dubbing cassette tapes to get a copy of a game sucked and my dream as a kid was getting a real disk drive. They were faster, could store more data than a
              cassette tape and copying them was relatively easier than copying cassettes since disk drives didn’t require that data be copied in real time.</p>
            <p name="3522" id="3522" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But disk drives were expensive peripherals in the early days of computing and my family was poor.</p>
            <p name="6f2c" id="6f2c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The base model Atari 810 disk drive retailed for around $299 back in the early 1980s and that was basically close to the $499 cost of the Atari 400 I had.</p>
            <p name="30a7" id="30a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My $2 a week allowance was good for saving up for small kid things like toys, comics and books. But even if I stopped buying stuff and diligently saved up my weekly allowance it
              would take me nearly 3 years to save up $299 on my own.</p>
            <p name="7cec" id="7cec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">So I was resigned to my life of being stuck with dealing with data cassettes for the glorified video game system my Atari 400 became.</p>

            <p name="35fb" id="35fb" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">One day I was playing around Brighton Beach Avenue with some friends and ran past the window of of a neighborhood shop called, “Surplus City.” As the name implied, the place was
              a classic, old school, NYC mom and pop junk shop located around tons of other mom and pop junk shops in the junky neighborhood I lived in. That said, I had nothing against junk shops: My mom liked the place and I genuinely enjoyed
              rummaging through the piles of junk in that place with my mom when she dragged me along on one of her neighborhood bargain hunting trips.</p>
            <p name="0589" id="0589" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But on this day it was just me and a bunch of kids horsing around when I noticed something in the front window of “Surplus City.” There, mixed in with the literal tons of
              smashed, stacked and shoved clothes, schmattas, rags and accessories on a shelf in the window was the unmistakable light brownish beige color of an Atari peripheral.</p>
            <p name="2fe6" id="2fe6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I walked closer to the window and checked it out and based on what I could see, it looked like it was either an Atari 810 disk drive or an Atari 820 receipt printer.</p>
            <p name="e745" id="e745" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I walked into the store and asked the old lady behind the counter if I could see it. She had no idea what I was talking about, so I had to guide her to pull it out of the pile of
              junk in the window.</p>
            <p name="124e" id="124e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And when she pulled it out, I was stunned: It was an Atari 810 disk drive!</p>
            <p name="4f0a" id="4f0a" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“What is this? You want it?” she asked and I said yes. She shouted out to someone in the backroom asking for a price and they shouted back “Twenty
              five dollars! As is!”</p>
            <p name="fa35" id="fa35" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Okay! $25. You want it?” she asked. And I basically said, “Yeah, but I need to get the money.” And with that she put it behind the counter and said,
              “I’ll hold it for you. When you get the money come back.”</p>
            <p name="49bc" id="49bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I walked out of the store and told my friends they wanted $25 for it. One responded, “That’s cheap! You should get it.” But someone else pointed out that it didn’t
              come with any cables and you can’t tell if it works. And they were right. But my thoughts were for $25 it was worth the gamble. And besides, my brother was an electrical engineer so he could help me fix it if need be, right?</p>

            <p name="bfb9" id="bfb9" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">I headed back home and told my dad about the disk drive. His response was “Twenty five dollars? Are you sure this is a good thing?”</p>
            <p name="4630" id="4630" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Yes!” I said. Also, when he started talking to my mom about it I realized she basically knew the people who owned the store so if the thing was dead
              and my brother couldn’t fix it, we could haggle them to accept a return.</p>
            <p name="f710" id="f710" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Okay, let’s go,” my dad said and with that we both headed outside.</p>
            <p name="0855" id="0855" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The sun was setting but the shop was only about 4 blocks away.</p>
            <p name="a4d3" id="a4d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I went into the store with my dad, the woman behind the counter recognized me and pulled then Atari 810 disk drive out. “See!” I said as he looked it over. After a while he said,
              “Okay, good. We’ll take it.” And with that my dad handed over the $25, the woman placed the bare disk drive into a used, nondescript shopping bag and we headed back home.</p>
            <p name="9d38" id="9d38" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When we got home, my dad handed me the bag and I took the disk drive out. Yup! It was an Atari 810 disk drive. And it looked clean and good. But without a power supply or data
              cable, there was no way I could test it out.</p>
            <p name="47c2" id="47c2" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing">“Maybe you should talk to Ben about this?” my dad asked. And with that I went over to the phone and dialed up my brother in his place
              in Washington Heights.</p>

            <p name="1d8b" id="1d8b" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">I generally never called my brother directly and only really talked to him on the phone if he called up and asked for me or my dad called him up and he asked for me. So this was
              technically the first time I called him as an independent person asking him for help.</p>
            <p name="f826" id="f826" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Why did you buy this?!?” he immediately shouted over the phone when I told him about the disk drive. “It was cheap and I am sure it works!” I said,
              to which he responded “I don’t know. I don’t have time for this.” There was a pregnant pause and I simply said, “I’ll let you talk to dad.” And with that I passed the phone over to my father.</p>
            <p name="ea0a" id="ea0a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When my dad grabbed the handset I looked for a copy of the yellow pages and brought it to my room.</p>
            <p name="3c98" id="3c98" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I flipped through to the electronics section, then the computer section and started to look through the listings. I was looking for some kind of official Atari repair place and
              soon I found one: They were located on the Upper West Side — which was another planet compared to the ass end of Brooklyn I lived in — but they seemed legit; their ad had lots of logos and they were proud to be in business for a
              seemingly decent amount of time.</p>
            <p name="8de9" id="8de9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I wrote down the phone number and address of the place and showed it to my dad after he got off the phone with my brother.</p>
            <p name="8aa0" id="8aa0" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing">“I think they have the parts we need,” I explained. And my dad nodded and said it was too late to call them up so I should call them
              the next day.</p>

            <p name="51f6" id="51f6" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">The next day I called them up. The guy on the phone seemed to think it was a joke or something that some young kid was calling him up asking about an Atari 810 disk drive cable.
            </p>
            <p name="ba95" id="ba95" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Sure we have that. Power supply too,” the guy said, “So what are your hours I asked?” and with that I made note of the hours, cost and everything and
              shared it with my dad.</p>
            <p name="f565" id="f565" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Okay, next weekend. Good?” he said and I agreed.</p>
            <p name="1fd7" id="1fd7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By the time the next weekend rolled around, my dad had already figured out what train we needed to take. I am pretty sure we needed to get to 72nd Street on the Upper West Side
              and my dad had already mapped it out.</p>
            <p name="7604" id="7604" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So we headed out there, got off the train and headed to some tree-lined block filled with old buildings. When we got to the place, it wasn’t a regular storefront but rather one
              of those “basement of a brownstone” stores that just had some tin sign hanging out front near the garbage cans and staircase that lead to their store.</p>
            <p name="5f7d" id="5f7d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I went downstairs with my dad and headed to the counter. Seemed like the place was a purely service and repair shop so it made sense they were in this basement space. The guy
              behind the counter was a bit stunned when he realized I was the kid that called up a week earlier, but was happy to oblige.</p>
            <p name="87bb" id="87bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The guy pulled out what looked to be a clean and solid homemade Atari disk drive cable — official cables were all black while this one was bluish grey — and an
              official Atari disk drive AC adapter, wrote out a receipt, my dad paid for it and we headed outside and back to the subway to head back home.</p>

            <p name="c996" id="c996" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">When we got back home, I carefully connected the Atari 810 disk drive to my Atari 400 with that new data cable and inserted a bootable diskette into the drive that a friend let
              me borrow. The disk had Atari DOS on it, so all I had to do was power up the Atari 400 and let it boot. And if it booted, it worked? And lo and behold within seconds of turning the machine on, it booted from the diskette! It worked! I
              was so excited and happy!</p>
            <p name="e136" id="e136" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“It works?” my dad said. “Yes!” I shouted; happy and excited. My mom waddled over to my room to see what was happening and my dad explained it to her.
            </p>
            <p name="2b46" id="2b46" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“This was cheap, right?” she asked to which I replied, “Yes, it was!” And I pulled out some catalog or newspaper ad to show her the retail price for
              it. “$299 and you pay $25? Very good!” she said kissing me on my head.</p>
            <p name="9ed8" id="9ed8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yeah, a Jewish mother was proud of her Jewish son getting something at a deep discount. But who cared? It was indeed a bargain and it worked great! Why pay more for the same?</p>
            <p name="aab6" id="aab6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Things were happy until the phone rang. It was my brother doing his weekly check in.</p>
            <p name="70a5" id="70a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My dad briefly mentioned that the Atari 810 disk drive worked and then passed the phone onto me.</p>
            <p name="9eba" id="9eba" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“So it works?” my brother asked and I replied, “Yes! It works!”</p>
            <p name="0ff5" id="0ff5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He then grilled me on how I got a cable and power supply and I explained how I found a store. There was no joy in his voice; just seething anger at the mere idea his younger
              brother was able to solve a problem independently without him.</p>
            <p name="61c3" id="61c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">His voice became noticeably angrier when I mentioned the power supply and he said, “You don’t need an Atari power supply! You can use any kind of power supply!”</p>
            <p name="e4a0" id="e4a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As he shouted at me over the phone I was at a loss. He’s 20 years older than me, a graduate of Columbia University and was the same person who refused to help me when I initially
              asked him to help me and now he’s yelling at me because I bought an official Atari part on my own? If he believed a non-Atari power supply would have worked, then why didn’t he offer to help me find one to begin with?</p>
            <p name="32dd" id="32dd" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“It works,” is all I said as a reply. Then there was a pregnant pause, a bit of angry breathing and then — seemingly at a loss for words — he asked me
              to pass the phone back to my dad and I did.</p>
            <p name="1191" id="1191" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While my dad talked to my brother on the phone, I went back to my room and played around with Atari DOS. Sure it was a boring system utility and not much else, but I needed to
              learn how to use it if I was going to use that disk drive to load and copy games.</p>
            <p name="8561" id="8561" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">My family might have been poor, but at least we were resourceful and knew how to best use what little we had — and whatever we scavenged from whatever junk store
              or pile of garbage we gleaned stuff from — to make our life a bit better in our own way.</p>
