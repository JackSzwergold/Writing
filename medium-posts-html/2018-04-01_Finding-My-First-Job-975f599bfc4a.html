              <figcaption class="imageCaption">A photo a bunch of money. (Photo by Jack Szwergold; Taken March 31, 2018)</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p name="1a3c" id="1a3c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I was about 14 years old and wanted a summer job. Every other friend of mine had a summer job doing something somewhere, and I wanted one too. I wanted the independence, the
              freedom but — most of all — I wanted the money a job would give me.</p>
            <p name="4616" id="4616" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So around the time of my 14th birthday I started to look for jobs but really had no idea where to start. I told my parents I wanted a job and my mom said she would ask someone at
              her factory if I could get a job. I was kind of excited, but not sure what that meant. My mom got up really early each day — like at around 5:00am — and worked long hours and usually came home and collapsed in bed. Maybe there was some
              summer job for a teenager at the factory I could handle? Who knows.</p>
            <p name="335b" id="335b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anyway, during one of my brother’s visits to the family home, he got wind of me wanting a job while sitting at the kitchen table, Before he could say anything our mom would say,
              “Yes! I will get a Jack a job in the factory. A good job!” to which my brother started shouting and screaming about.</p>
            <p name="08b7" id="08b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have no idea what the shouting and screaming was about — why should my brother care about me wanting a job — but I finished my food, excused myself and headed back to my room.
            </p>
            <p name="b45e" id="b45e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The fighting persisted for some time until it stopped. I knew something was up since — while my mom and dad weren’t fighting — I could hear them worriedly talking to each other.
              The hushed tones continued and then died off as the TV went on in the living room.</p>
            <p name="0501" id="0501" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then I heard a knock on my door.</p>
            <p name="98a8" id="98a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was my dad who peeked into my room and said, “I don’t know… Working at mom’s factory might not be a good idea… Your brother knows…” and then he went away.</p>
            <p name="0f62" id="0f62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Soon afterwards my brother came into my room and sat down on the floor in front of me and calmly said, “If you want a job I have a very good job for you at Columbia University.”
            </p>
            <p name="e434" id="e434" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Really?” I said, “Doing what?” I asked.</p>
            <p name="8940" id="8940" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Don’t worry, it’s very good… Just come to me on Monday and I will show you…”</p>
            <p name="ae17" id="ae17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With that he left my room and I waited for Monday to happen.</p>
            <p name="4503" id="4503" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I took the train up to Columbia University by myself. D to 59th Street to the A to 168h Street. Got off of the train and walked to the building my brother’s lab was in.</p>
            <p name="390f" id="390f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He was outside waiting for me and waved. I imagined he would show me someone — or bring me someplace — where I could get a real job. I imagined that for a place like Columbia
              University I would need working papers — since I was only 14 at the time — but my brother said not too worry.</p>
            <p name="e5c4" id="e5c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We went into the building and headed up the the elevator. Where I did not know?</p>
            <p name="1b03" id="1b03" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“What kind of job is this again?” I asked and he said, “You will see…” he said, “Don’t worry…” he added.</p>
            <p name="1e68" id="1e68" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And soon enough we got off at some nondescript floor, walked into a nondescript room and my brother said, “Here is where you will work!” I was confused… I saw nobody else… Just
              me and my brother in this miscellaneous chemistry lab.</p>
            <p name="3e5d" id="3e5d" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Here?” I asked. “Who am I working for?” I asked again.</p>
            <p name="0bbb" id="0bbb" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Me! You can be my assistant!” he said proudly.</p>
            <p name="46c0" id="46c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And with that I felt my mind twist and contort itself into a knot. This is not what I wanted. I wanted a real job where I would be paid. I asked my brother who would pay
              me — assuming there was some kind of arrangement with the university and this was normal arrangement — and he responded, “I will! Don’t worry!“</p>
            <p name="2e26" id="2e26" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And with that I had no idea what to do. If I left at that moment, my brother would cut me off and corner me; there was no way I could get away. In his dysfunctional mind it was
              perfectly normal that he would lure me into a situation like this, pay me out of his own pocket for a “job” that he just arbitrarily made up so there was no simple escape. So I decided to stay and make the best of it.</p>
            <p name="7ac2" id="7ac2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I ran some small errands for him around his lab, but for the most part my supposed “job” was to simply sit there and listen to my brother endlessly bather on about his work as if
              I cared. And lord knows I did not care at all.</p>
            <p name="a32d" id="a32d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You see, when I was 14 I was in some required science classes in Junior High School. I didn’t particularly like them or hate them; they were simply required classes. But in his
              mind the fact I was — for example — studying biochemistry meant I actually had a passion for the subject. Thus somehow I would care to listen to him blather on and on about whatever grad student class bullshit he was doing as if I
              cared.</p>
            <p name="0376" id="0376" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In between that bullshit I did things like use pipettes to fill things or use the autoclave to disinfect things. But there was no independence in these tasks. No matter what I
              did or how I did it, my brother was hovering nearby, micromanaging me. Micromanaging me so much that he might as well have just done the work himself.</p>
            <p name="fc50" id="fc50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Needless to say, this “job” was horrible. But at least he paid. How much, I don’t remember, but I remember at the end of each day he would pull some money out of his pocket and
              give it to me. It felt less like a job and more like he was paying me to be his friend; which in retrospect is really all the “job” was.</p>
            <p name="09be" id="09be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I went along with this for a few weeks. The thing is he was able to buy my friendship since I was young, naive and stupid and I did want the money. But then — at some point — our
              father got wind of what my brother was doing and was angry. He said I should not take his money… He would just give me whatever money I needed.</p>
            <p name="28e4" id="28e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Superficially this seemed great financially, but it was horrible otherwise: My dysfunctional brother wants to literally buy my friendship and my father is threatened by my
              brother’s behavior and this is not a “job” I wanted and I did not know what to do.</p>
            <p name="a5a3" id="a5a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So one day I talked to a friend of mine who worked at a local Knish store and asked if he could hook me up with a job. “But don’t you already have one?” he said. “It’s not a real
              job. It stinks,” I replied. And he said he would ask and see but it wasn’t like it would happen right away. I understood and told him I was cool with that and left it at that.</p>
            <p name="bce9" id="bce9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A week or so before my friend was going to hook me up with a job at the Knish shop, I was at Columbia University “working” for my brother again just waiting for this bullshit to
              end.</p>
            <p name="9f8e" id="9f8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was tasked with doing something and something was clearly not going right, so I asked him for help. “You should just use the stuff in that bottle over there.” he shouted.
              “Which one?” I replied. “I just don’t understand what is happening.” “You’ve done this before,“ he retorted condescendingly, “You know what you should be doing.” But I didn’t know what I should do nor did ever do this before; he was
              simply delusional and projecting his knowledge on me. He somehow believes that because we are biological siblings we are somehow psychic and even have the same skills.</p>
            <p name="15fa" id="15fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So in an effort to fix what was screwed up I grabbed the nearest bottle of stuff and carefully put it into the test tubes. Nothing changed. “I need your help,” I asked yet again.
              “I don’t think I did the right thing.” I said trying to hold back my frustration in trying to communicate with him.</p>
            <p name="4365" id="4365" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With that he angrily came over, saw what I did and started to scream at me about how I was “stupid” and ruined this project. I started to stammer and almost cry… I really didn’t
              know what I was supposed to do or why the thing wasn’t working. I asked for help, right? Anyway, in a huff he took the test tubes and walked out of the lab.</p>
            <p name="6cac" id="6cac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I felt stunned, shocked and assaulted. I looked at the wall at a nearby calendar and tried to calculate how much more days of this I had to deal with. At best one week if I could
              get the job at the Knish place. But that one week seemed like an eternity.</p>
            <p name="60d0" id="60d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I turned to a nearby sink and noticed some dry ice in a box next to it. The dry ice was leftover from some delivery so it was no longer need. I broke off some pieces and dropped
              them in the sink as the water was running. A carbon dioxide cloud filled the air. I thought about my brother’s yelling, temper and anger and just shoved my head straight into the cloud of carbon dioxide.</p>
            <p name="9342" id="9342" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I knew I couldn’t breathe it, but at that moment I wanted to feel nothing and feel something different than the pain I was feeling. I needed to have some quick escape from this
              bullshit. So for that brief moment I suffocated myself. The pain was gone a small bit and it felt good. But within a few seconds a new pain came into me; the pain of actually not being able to breathe.</p>
            <p name="5451" id="5451" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I quickly pulled my head out, grasped my throat with my hands and gasped for air when my brother came into lab.</p>
            <p name="a4a2" id="a4a2" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“What happened?” he said, looking straight at me.</p>
            <p name="f87a" id="f87a" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Nothing!” I said as I audibly gasped for air.</p>
            <p name="eb54" id="eb54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My brother could clearly see what was happening but shook it off as, “No big deal.” Despite me clearly gasping for air, he did not run over and do anything to help me. He simply
              placed the test tubes on the table and went back to work undoing the damage to his work I had done.</p>
            <p name="230c" id="230c" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You are not stupid? Why did you do this?” he asked me again, oblivious not only to the fact I had no idea what this work entailed but also oblivious
              to the fact I was still struggling to breathe.</p>
            <p name="5381" id="5381" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After a few minutes I started to feel normal again, while my brother was still hunched over the test tubes still doing his work when I spontaneously said, “I am going home…”</p>
            <p name="6877" id="6877" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“No! Wait! I will drive you!” he shouted, which was odd. He occasionally hijacked my attempts to leave on my own in the past, but as long as I had
              been “working” for him, he knew I would take the train home.</p>
            <p name="4d85" id="4d85" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Yes! I am going home.” I said to him as I walked out the lab door and headed home.</p>
            <p name="a610" id="a610" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As I waited on the train platform for the A train to show up, I imagined him running down the staircase and felt paralyzed. When the train finally arrived, I jumped in but
              worried that when it got to 59th Street he would somehow show up there, but he didn’t.</p>
            <p name="a225" id="a225" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When the D train finally pulled into 59th Street and he was nowhere to be seen, I started to relax a bit.</p>
            <p name="fb01" id="fb01" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As the D train exited Prospect Park station and was awash with the afternoon sunlight I felt better. I was even able to take a brief nap on the train since the trip was so long.
            </p>
            <p name="840a" id="840a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When it got to Ocean Parkway, I got off and walked down the block and headed home. When I got upstairs, my father noticed how stressed I looked asked “What happened?” To which I
              replied, “Nothing…”</p>
            <p name="b1c2" id="b1c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My father told me I had a call from a friend of a friend. It ended up being the guy who worked in the Knish shop. So I called him, headed over to his home and found out I could
              start working in a few days if I wanted to.</p>
            <p name="3278" id="3278" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What a relief! I finally landed my first job on my own.</p>
            <p name="31a6" id="31a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I got home again that night my father was on the phone with my brother as I walked in the door. I’m not too sure my brother told our father the full story, but he seemed to
              know something was up.</p>
            <p name="a581" id="a581" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Jack!” he said. “Your brother is on the phone!” he added as he passed the phone to me.</p>
            <p name="47c9" id="47c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I grabbed the phone and my brother asked, “How are you doing? What happened?” to which I replied, “I don’t want to work for you anymore. I have a new job.” and as I said that I
              could hear his breathing get more intense and his tone and anger growing. “What do you mean?!?” he said to which I said, “I have a new job! Goodbye!” and with that I passed the phone back to my dad, ran to my room and collapsed on the
              sofa.</p>
            <p name="a15d" id="a15d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I could hear my father and my brother fighting on the phone, but soon enough it calmed down. My father came to my room and asked me if I was hungry. I said I was
              okay, and with that I got ready to sleep.</p>

            <p name="41cc" id="41cc" class="graf graf--p graf--leading"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Epilogue</strong>: A week later I started my new job. It was filled with all kinds of new challenges. Like needing to wear a clean
              white t-shirt each day and being careful when making Sanka for some patrons since they were very specific about whether the Sanka gets poured in before the water or not. I also learned how to clean a hot dog roller machine with seltzer
              and a rag.</p>
            <p name="b24f" id="b24f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anyway, one Saturday before I was headed to work my brother called and told my father he wanted to speak to me. I took the phone and asked what he wanted. He wanted to talk to me
              when he came over that afternoon. I pointed out I couldn’t talk to him since I was working and I could hear him start to get angry again. I said I had to leave to go to work, passed the phone back to my father and left.</p>
            <p name="1825" id="1825" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A few hours into my shift, without warning, my brother showed up at the Knish shop. It was weird. I’ve had friends visit me at the place before and they would just come up to the
              counter or window and say “Hello!”</p>
            <p name="e4c4" id="e4c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not my brother.</p>
            <p name="c5d2" id="c5d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He came in and sat at the very end of the counter and just stared at me. I walked over to him and asked him what he wanted. There was no hello and no common courtesy past an odd
              head nod. He just sat at the counter not ordering but looking at me.</p>
            <p name="67aa" id="67aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This made me nervous, but he didn’t seem to care. Then one of my co-workers asked what was up and I shrugged. My brother noticed that and without a word stood up and left.</p>
            <p name="b315" id="b315" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Who was that?” my co-worker asked.</p>
            <p name="8ee8" id="8ee8" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“That’s my brother,” I said as I cleaned the counter with a rag and watched as he walked across Coney Island Avenue to — presumably — head back home.
            </p>
            <p name="1a79" id="1a79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I felt like crying at that moment but didn’t since I was at work. I had no idea how to react to my brother showing up like a stalker at the place I worked. Or how
              to react to my co-workers after they witnessed this bizarre behavior. So I just went on with my day and — eventually — headed back home.</p>
