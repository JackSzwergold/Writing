            <p name="9e2f" id="9e2f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">It was the mid 1980s. Maybe 1986 or so. For argument’s sake I’ll say it was an evening during the summer of 1986 because it was the year most everyone was graduating from
              high school and going off to wherever.</p>
            <p name="274b" id="274b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My main memories were of doing not much of anything more than hanging out with friends, riding my bike around Brooklyn and hanging out at various beaches around the area.</p>
            <p name="aacc" id="aacc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My friend Alex was still in town. He would soon be heading off to college out in the Midwest, while I was simply sleepwalking through college by going to Brooklyn College; a 4
              year CUNY that was basically not much better than a 2 year school.</p>
            <p name="6168" id="6168" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One day while lounging around at home, I got a call from Alex. “I need your help,” he said. “What happened,” I asked. “Let me pick you up and I’ll explain.”</p>
            <p name="4be0" id="4be0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So with that I headed downstairs and waited for him to show up. And in a few minutes he did in his dad’s Volvo.</p>
            <p name="9ff3" id="9ff3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I hopped in the front seat and we drove off.</p>

            <p name="ffbd" id="ffbd" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf--leading">“So what’s happening?” I asked.</p>
            <p name="3540" id="3540" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“One of the hubcaps on the car is missing,” he said. He sounded a little nervous, but was driving cool and deliberately nonetheless.</p>
            <p name="4454" id="4454" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We pulled onto the Belt Parkway and explained more.</p>
            <p name="05a4" id="05a4" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I don’t know when or how it happened, but one of the rear hubcaps was stolen or flew off,” he said. “Which one?” I asked and he said, “Right one.”
              And with that I rolled down my window and looked at the back tire. Not the greatest view but I could still see there was not much of anything there.</p>
            <p name="e912" id="e912" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“So what do you want to do?” I asked. “You know of any places that sell Volvo hubcaps?”</p>
            <p name="87c9" id="87c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He responded, “No. But I know where we can get one. Look on the floor.”</p>
            <p name="a1f2" id="a1f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I looked on the floor of the car and saw a crowbar and a flashlight.</p>
            <p name="cf8d" id="cf8d" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I’m driving to Mill Basin. We’ll find someone’s Volvo and I want you to get out and get their hubcap.”</p>
            <p name="4024" id="4024" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I paused and basically just said, “Really?” And added “You want me to get out of the car and steal someone’s hubcap?”</p>
            <p name="733c" id="733c" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Yes. It’s easy,” he said.</p>
            <p name="3925" id="3925" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“So why don’t you do it?” I asked.</p>
            <p name="465e" id="465e" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Because I’m the one driving,” he said.</p>
            <p name="6029" id="6029" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">And with that, we got off of the Belt Parkway around Flatbush Avenue and headed up towards Avenue U and Mill Basin.</p>

            <p name="9ddf" id="9ddf" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Mill Basin was a quiet and somewhat isolated neighborhood in deep Brooklyn. It was a suburb in the classic deep Brooklyn sense that it was filled with single family homes and
              lawns and — because of its relative geographic isolation from public transportation and specifically the subways — it was a world on its own. A gated community without a gate.</p>
            <p name="978e" id="978e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We drove into Mill Basin and slowly cruised around from block to block looking for Volvos of the relatively same make and model as the Volvo Alex’s dad had.</p>
            <p name="870b" id="870b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was a fairly tedious and creepy task.</p>
            <p name="b369" id="b369" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Maybe we should just call it a day and head home,” I said. “I mean if you told your dad what happened I’m sure it wouldn’t be a big deal?”</p>
            <p name="1312" id="1312" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When we stopped at the next light Alex simply turned, looked at me and said, “I don’t think so.”</p>
            <p name="1a32" id="1a32" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As we sat and waited for the light to change Alex spotted a Volvo parked on a nearby block.</p>
            <p name="e7ba" id="e7ba" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“There! Look!” he said pointing to a car on the right side of the street ahead of us.</p>
            <p name="8ff2" id="8ff2" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Now what?” I asked.</p>
            <p name="c814" id="c814" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing">“Just get out when we get near it and do it,” he said as we slowly cruised through the intersection and headed to that other, parked
              Volvo.</p>

          <div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn">
            <p name="49e1" id="49e1" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">As Alex slowly drove to the car, I grabbed the crowbar and flashlight and ducked out and ran around to the other side.</p>
            <p name="5e53" id="5e53" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It felt crazy to be doing this. I knew a lot of shady characters and lowlifes growing up in a Brooklyn but any crime past petty shoplifting was something someone else did. Not
              me. Won’t lie but it felt exhilarating, but also silly… Especially since I was just dressed in an outfit of an Ocean Pacific long sleeve t-shirt and shorts and Converse high tops sans socks. I was ready to go to the beach; not steal a
              hubcap.</p>
            <p name="7c5a" id="7c5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anyway, as I got to the other side of the car I flipped on the flashlight I was suddenly drowned in light… But not from my flashlight but some lights right behind me.</p>
            <p name="d341" id="d341" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I turned around, saw some bright lights, hoped it wasn’t from a mob of homeowners and then just decided to bolt back to Alex’s car.</p>
            <p name="9737" id="9737" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“What was that?” I asked as I settled into the passenger seat.</p>
            <p name="daad" id="daad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We both turned to look and drove off slowly. Just as we figured out what the source of the light was, it turned off.</p>
            <p name="faff" id="faff" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Do you see anybody?” Alex asked. I replied, “No.” as we drove off to the corner of the block.</p>
            <p name="1d35" id="1d35" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With that we circled the block and stopped at the corner. Alex said, “Get out here and just walk over and see what happens,” so I went ahead and did that: Got out of the car with
              the crowbar and flashlight in hand and walked over to the Volvo.</p>
            <p name="8866" id="8866" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Before I even got there, floodlights from the house on the corner lit up. I stood still and waited for shouting or dog barking to pierce the quiet night, but that didn’t happen.
              I stood still for a while, looked for signs of life inside the house and saw utterly nothing.</p>
            <p name="aa59" id="aa59" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After a minute or so the lights went off. So I started to walk towards the Volvo again. And after no more than two small steps, the lights went on again.</p>
            <p name="1ff1" id="1ff1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I figured it out. The lights were detecting motion. Never saw such a security device before, but what else could be happening?</p>
            <p name="8de7" id="8de7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I veered away from the sidewalk and walked over to Alex’s car. He rolled down the driver’s side window and asked, “What’s happening?”</p>
            <p name="48f4" id="48f4" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Motion defectors,” I said. “Why else would those lights be going on and off and nobody is coming out to say anything?”</p>
            <p name="178b" id="178b" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Well, try getting that hubcap one more time,” he said.</p>
            <p name="032e" id="032e" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Really?” I asked and he simply replied, “Really.”</p>
            <p name="33a1" id="33a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So without running or acting sneaky, I just walked up to that Volvo again and with a second of me just standing there the floodlights lit up the front lawn, me and the target
              Volvo.</p>
            <p name="4ffe" id="4ffe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I looked at Alex in the car, shrugged and he shrugged in response and with that I walked over, got into the car and with that we drove off.</p>
            <p name="0f61" id="0f61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Alex still insisted on looking around for another Volvo to rip a hubcap off of. Soon we found one and the second he pulled in behind it, flood lights on that house turned on as
              well.</p>
            <p name="d4ac" id="d4ac" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“What the fuck?” he said. “Yeah,” I responded.</p>
            <p name="4827" id="4827" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And with that we drove off and headed to a diner. Maybe “The Floridian” near Kings Plaza Mall or even “El Greco” in Sheepshead Bay closer to where we lived.</p>
            <p name="140c" id="140c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We sat around eating and thinking. I was enjoying my milkshake and fries and simply asked, “No what?” Alex responded, “Forget about it. Just calling it night.”</p>
            <p name="df6f" id="df6f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">We settled the bill and just headed home sans replacement hubcap.</p>
