            <p name="3698" id="3698" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I got the scalper’s number from a neighborhood friend who worked for him. I wanted some tickets for <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Rush</em>’s 1984 “Grace Under Pressure”
              tour and this scalper was the guy who could help.</p>
            <p name="cd34" id="cd34" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I called him up and immediately it was one of these frantic and sketchy “Who are you? Why are you calling” calls. I mentioned my friend’s name and he started to calm down a bit.
              I gave him my phone number, told him I lived nearby, wanted to buy a few <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Rush</em>tickets and already had the money on me for the tickets.</p>
            <p name="47bc" id="47bc" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Okay, if you want to come over, come over like at 7:00pm,” he said and then gave me his address. “Great! See you then,” I responded.</p>
            <p name="915f" id="915f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was about to hang up the phone when he said, “Jack, do me a favor if you don’t mind. Buy me a container of milk when you come by. I’ll pay you back.” The milk request was odd
              to me, but I agreed and said I would see him soon.</p>
            <p name="e8ba" id="e8ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Right after I hung up, I pulled out a map and looked at the address he gave me. He lived in the same building as a friend of mine and even the apartment number was basically on
              the same floor. That seemed odd.</p>
            <p name="709f" id="709f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, I told my parents I was running out for a second and would be back soon. “Where are you going?” My dad asked and I said I was going to buy tickets from some guy a friend told
              me about. “Be careful,” my dad said and with that I headed out the door and over to the scalper’s place.</p>
            <p name="9c43" id="9c43" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Buying milk was not hard at all. Just went down to my corner place, picked up a quart of milk and then continued on my journey. But it still felt weird to buy a quart of milk and
              then walk in another direction that wasn’t home.</p>
            <p name="c007" id="c007" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A block or two before I got to the building I pulled out the piece of paper with the address details on them to memorize the apartment number. This was Brooklyn in the 1980s and
              I didn’t want to seem lost since if you seemed lost, you were a potential target. And I didn’t want to be a target. I just wanted to give this guy his milk, buy some <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Rush</em> tickets and head back
              home.</p>
            <p name="f7b7" id="f7b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I got to the building I passed by the usual cadre of “security guards” that was in front of every Brighton Beach building: Old men and ladies in folding chairs. They
              couldn’t do much but gossip about you in Yiddish if you caught their eye. But still, to be a teen and have to fight to leave your apartment and then — after that domestic grief — to have deal with these fucking yentas always stressed me
              out. But regardless, I made it to the lobby, pressed his buzzer and headed upstairs.</p>
            <p name="fea1" id="fea1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As luck would have it my friend and his parents were just coming home at that moment. “Hey Jack! What are you doing here?” he said. “Heading over to your neighbor’s place,” I
              said. The blood seemed to run out of their faces and the pause was extremely pregnant and awkward. “I’m going to buy some tickets from him,” I said and they relaxed a bit. “Well, if anything happens let us know,” he said as they slowly
              closed the door, looking at me as I turned around and rang the bell of the scalper’s apartment.</p>
            <p name="56b6" id="56b6" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Who is it?” said the scalper as he peered at me through the peephole. “It’s Jack and I got the milk!” I said as I held up the brown paper bag. I
              heard the locks unlock, the chain drop and the door open. “Come on in,” he said as he opened the door and let me into his dark, dim, badly lit apartment.</p>
            <p name="0b50" id="0b50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The only real light in the place came from the kitchen which had some crappy metal table in the middle of it and a refrigerator to the left of the table. He was a fairly schlubby
              middle-aged, dark haired Jewish guy with a mustache and curly hair. We both walked into the kitchen and gave him the milk he asked for. “Thanks for the milk,” he said as he opened the fridge and put it inside. It was odd since I could
              clearly see there was another milk container in there; maybe it was spoiled?</p>
            <p name="2c90" id="2c90" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But more importantly with the extra light I got a closer look at the fridge: It was seemed to be covered from top to bottom with satin cloth backstage pass stickers from tons of
              concerts. I recognized passes from bands like <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Police</em>, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Van Halen</em>, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Cars</em> and others. This guy really was
              into the music business it seemed. Well at least his little “ticket brokering” side of the business.</p>
            <p name="536d" id="536d" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“So you want to go see <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Rush</em>?” he asked. “Yeah,” I responded. I needed four tickets and gave him $100 for it.
              “Why do you like this band? They’re a kid’s band.” he said as he counted the money, took out a zipper bag filled with tickets and pulled them out for me to checkout. I picked out a decent set of floor tickets and said I was cool.</p>
            <p name="13ce" id="13ce" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Okay, all good. You know I might have to eat these extras. You know anybody who might want them?” I said no while looking at his refrigerator again.
              In addition to the backstage passes there were pictures of him with youngish Asian women on the refrigerator as well.</p>
            <p name="0ee0" id="0ee0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All the pictures were set in some tropical vacation locale. And they were standard shots taken of him with them at patio tables and in front of the scenery — water, trees,
              mountains, etc… — with the only thing really changing being the women themselves. Maybe it was their hairstyles or something else but all of the women were Asian, but they all looked different.</p>
            <p name="9408" id="9408" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Girlfriends?” I said, motioning to the pictures. “Yeah, I don’t know… They’re friends!” he said. And with that I was headed out of the apartment.</p>
            <p name="933f" id="933f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Just before the got to the front door I remembered that he hadn’t paid me back for milk I bought and mentioned it to him. “Shit! You’re right!” he said as he fumbled through his
              pockets and got out a dollar and change for the milk. “Thanks!” I said. “You’re welcome!” he said. And within a moment I was out in the hallway again.</p>
            <p name="d197" id="d197" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He closed the door and locked all the locks as I stood in the hallway front of his — and my friend’s — apartment. I thought about knocking to tell them I was okay, but I could
              hear my friend’s family eating dinner and didn’t want to disturb them. Besides, I was okay and didn’t need any help. So I instead I ran down the stairs, walked out the door, slipped past the phalanx of yentas and headed home.</p>
            <p name="65bc" id="65bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The tickets were tucked into the inside pocket of my denim jacket and I pulled them out at one point during the walk home to admire them: <em
                class="markup--em markup--p-em">Rush</em> at the Meadowlands! My first real arena concert! I mean, first real concert was seeing <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Sting</em> solo on the “Dream of the Blue Turtles” tour at <em
                class="markup--em markup--p-em">Radio City Music Hall</em>, but that was a concert hall. An arena show was something completely different.</p>
            <p name="429b" id="429b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The next day at school I gave my friends the tickets I scored and a few weeks later we were at the Meadowlands to see <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Rush</em>.</p>
            <p name="efef" id="efef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was completely into the show and was wearing my official “Moving Pictures” t-shirt I got at <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Postermat</em> on 8th Street in the Village a
              few months beforehand. The encore was <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">2112</em> with a laser show and then the show ended.</p>
            <p name="173b" id="173b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As we gathered ourselves together to head back to Brooklyn, I spotted the scalper a few rows back and said hello. He told me he couldn’t sell all the tickets, so he decided to
              come to the show anyway. He looked as schlubby as before, but this time he wasn’t alone; he literally had two Asian women — one on each arm — hanging out with him.</p>
            <p name="625a" id="625a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Neither one of them looked anything like any of the other women in the pictures on his refrigerator. And all three of them — including him — had satin cloth
              backstage pass stickers stuck to their shirts.</p>
