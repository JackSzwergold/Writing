            </figure>
            <p name="eb88" id="eb88" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Weeks — possibly months — had passed since I received that Atari 400 for my 13th birthday. While I had not seen hide nor hair of this “magical” BASIC cartridge my brother
              was endlessly talking about, I had moved up the ranks in <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Raiders</em> from “Garbage Scow Captain” to “Warrior.” It was a proud achievement of mine — and even my dad — but not to my brother. He
              saw games as nothing more than a distraction from the real purpose of a computer: Endlessly looking at lines of code to program something. Which was something I could not do — and didn’t even sound like fun — until I got that confounded
              BASIC cartridge.</p>
            <p name="d339" id="d339" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And then one week my brother showed up at our Brighton Beach home with the magical BASIC cartridge. And boy was it an underwhelming experience.</p>
            <p name="3861" id="3861" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Here it is!” he said as he passed it onto me. The packaging had been crushed and was opened since my brother and his wife wanted to try it out on the
              loaned Atari 800 they had in their home. So it was less than a part of a gift, and more of an aftermarket addition to the Atari 400 system I had.</p>
            <p name="244d" id="244d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After taking it out of the crushed box and sticking it into the slot of the Atari 400, my brother showed me some literal “basic” BASIC programming things such as how to create a
              GOTO loop. He also showed me some sine/cosine function I barely understood past it drawing a few curvy lines on the screen.</p>
            <p name="81a7" id="81a7" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“And now, you can program games!” he said with no awareness of how little I cared or even understood any of what he was showing me.</p>
            <p name="b96f" id="b96f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And you know, it retrospect this all sounds condescending and mean towards my brother. And maybe it is. At the end of the day he — and his wife at the time who truly initiated
              the purchase of this thing — did have good intentions with their actions. But the problem wasn’t what their intentions might have been as much as their endlessly stubborn attitude when it came to defining what should be done with gifts
              they gave to me or anyone else. If they gave me a computer it was to compute; not play games. Only “stupid” people do “stupid” things like enjoy playing games and such.</p>
            <p name="d7b1" id="d7b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As I said at the outset, by the time I given this BASIC cartridge I had already become a “Warrior” in <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Raiders</em>. And I was damned
              proud of that achievement and I tried to show him some of the achievements I had earned. But no sooner than I booted up the game to show him what I could do that he then turned around and shut the computer down, swapped out the
              cartridge and stuck in the BASIC cartridge yet again to show me more programming tips and tricks.</p>
            <p name="597a" id="597a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Cornered and powerless, all I could do was nod politely, listen to his seemingly endless self-centered, unwanted computer programming lessons and then pretend to program myself
              to make him happy with his efforts. Monkey see, monkey do… But this 13 year old “monkey” did not understand or care.</p>
            <p name="016e" id="016e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Programming an Atari 400 was not fun, but at some point I fooled myself into thinking I could program a game. Not for my own benefit, but more for my own self-preservation. If I
              could program something — anything — in BASIC and show my brother my “progress” as each week went on, I believed I could get him off my back. “See! I can program! Now go away!” was my own delusional “Stockholm Syndrome”-like way of
              dealing with this nonsense.</p>
            <p name="08d6" id="08d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But like most ideas 13 year olds come up with to deal with dysfunctional adults, it didn’t work.</p>
            <p name="0ff7" id="0ff7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My programming skills at the time stunk and — besides that — I didn’t enjoy it. My ideas of what I wanted to do and what my hamfisted programming skills could achieve was an
              endless source of pain and frustration to me. At the end of the day, the software and games that the professionals put out in the real-world market were far more satisfying and enjoyable to use than anything I could program.</p>
            <p name="6708" id="6708" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But one thing stopped me from truly enjoying the world of commercial software at the time: A lack of money and being 14 years old and not being able to really make decent money
              since I didn’t have a job nor any idea of how to get one.</p>
            <p name="e315" id="e315" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Young and frustrated with my prospects I pretty much resigned myself of an adolescent life of simply endlessly playing <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Raiders</em> and
              <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Space Invaders</em> while struggling to learn just enough BASIC to get my brother off of my back.</p>
            <p name="2940" id="2940" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Then I learned about pirated software and my whole world changed.</p>

            <p name="9228" id="9228" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">I learned about pirated software from my neighborhood friends who would copy and trade games with each other. You see, since most computer software at that time was available on
              cassette tapes, so simple software piracy at the time consisted of just hooking up two cassette decks — one to playback the cassette and the other to record the bleeps and bloops onto a blank cassette — and copying the cassette. If you
              knew how to copy music cassette tape, you knew how to copy a computer cassette tape.</p>
            <p name="1560" id="1560" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This was a mind-blowing — and liberating — revelation to a 13 year old kid. For the price of some blank cassette tapes — that were cheap and plentiful at the time — I could have
              a small social circle of friends who were focused on copying, sharing and playing games. Who cares about how they were programmed? We could just all share in the fun of playing games together without draining our allowances.</p>
            <p name="3ae0" id="3ae0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But while software piracy liberated me to play the games I liked — and use the Atari 400 as a video game system I always wanted — whenever my brother would visit and see me
              playing games some incredibly indignant and violent outburst would occur. If I showed him the game I was playing, 9 times out of 10 he would declare it to be stupid and a “waste of time.” I had no idea how to respond to being demeaned
              like this so I let these outbursts pass and keep on playing as if nothing happened.</p>
            <p name="4b02" id="4b02" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Soon enough I was able to wrap myself up in these games that when my brother came over, the passive aggressive — or even outright aggressive — violence could be numbed by staring
              at these games and being immersed in this world.</p>
            <p name="da03" id="da03" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As time passed, and I acquired and played more and more games I scored through my small adolescent piracy circle of friends, my brother seemed to begrudgingly accept the fact
              that I only wanted to play video games and had no interest in programming a game. It felt like I won a victory against him until I realized that I was trapped in something I never wanted and had to endure years of verbal and
              psychological abuse because of this “gift.” Yes, I was finally able to make “lemonade out of lemons” by using this unwanted computer as a video game system, but I always lived under the fear of violence occurring when my brother saw me
              playing a video game.</p>
            <p name="f051" id="f051" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s going to sound whiny and privileged, but if I was only given a video game system at the time all could have been more peaceful and happy in my family. But instead — like all
              of my brother’s “gifts” and interactions — I had to get wrapped up in his dysfunctional bullshit.</p>
            <p name="dc1b" id="dc1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Hindsight always gives one a clearer perspective of how things in the past should have been handled. And in this case I should have done with that computer what I
              did with virtually all of the “gifts” he and his wife — and her overbearing family — gave me over the years: Pretend to enjoy it when it was given to me, then just not use it, then toss it in the closet for a while and then finally
              throw it out a few years later. But my family was poor and any gift was welcome because when you have nothing anything is something. And if you’re poor and you refuse a gift?</p>
