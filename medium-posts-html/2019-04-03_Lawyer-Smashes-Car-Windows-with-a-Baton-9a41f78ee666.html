            <p name="37db" id="37db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">His name was Kevin. God was that guy a dick, a tool, an asshole and all of the above and then some. But most of all we at the wacky weekly newspaper knew him as our lawyer.
            </p>
            <p name="5a41" id="5a41" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How he became the wacky weekly newspaper’s lawyer is vague but clear. It happened just before I started in the fall of 1995 and the way I understood it is he was a lawyer for a
              bunch of aging classic horror movie actors in Hollywood. He specialty was ambulance chasing perceived misuses of his clients name and image in many small cases. Small publications, local conventions and other similar gatherings. The
              works.</p>
            <p name="6cdc" id="6cdc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Technically speaking, he was acting within his — and his client’s — legal rights towards rights and fair compensation. But it was all really silly and sad when you think about
              it.</p>
            <p name="1d83" id="1d83" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So anyway, prior to me coming on board the wacky weekly newspaper, they apparently used the likeness of one of his clients pictures in one of their wacky fake news articles
              without securing proper rights and permissions. And out of nowhere, Kevin literally swooped into the newspaper’s offices and threatened to sue them out of existence. A compromise was struck where a financial settlement may or may not
              have been reached. But as a part of that deal, Kevin was retained as their attorney from that moment forward.</p>
            <p name="8770" id="8770" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We all hated him. When he helped he helped, but by that point in the wacky newspaper’s history, anyone with common sense could have advised on rights and permission issues. But
              still he got paid.</p>
            <p name="374c" id="374c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">And — just for context about what comes next — he was Jewish. Not like there is anything wrong with that.</p>

      <section name="c9f8" class="section section--body section--last">
        <div class="section-divider">
          <hr class="section-divider">
        </div>
        <div class="section-content">
          <div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn">
            <p name="a8f8" id="a8f8" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">So one day I came into work — maybe in 1996 or 1997 — and one of my co-workers dropped a copy of the local newspaper in front of me and said, “Check this out!” His finger pointed
              to a small — but prominent piece — below the fold that talked about Kevin damaging some Middle Eastern guy’s car outside of a local downtown hotel.</p>
            <p name="f8d8" id="f8d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Turns out his wife was screwing some Middle Eastern business man on the side and Kevin caught on. They were having a fling at that local hotel and Kevin decided the best way to
              handle the situation was to smash the guy’s car windows with a steel expandable tactical self-defense baton.</p>
            <p name="116a" id="116a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We all cracked up at that. Our ambulance chasing lawyer was using a “self-defense” baton to smash windows on the car of his wife’s lover as he flew into a jealous rage. What a
              hoot! There goes our lawyer, right?</p>
            <p name="612a" id="612a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anyway, as I read on it said that after he smashed the car, he immediately called the police, confessed to what he did and — as a result — didn’t get locked up or anything. It
              was the first time in my life I realized you could technically get away with committing a crime if you called the police right away and confessed that you were not in your right mind.</p>
            <p name="6095" id="6095" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We didn’t see Kevin for a few weeks, but some people at the wacky weekly newspaper had some contact with him. The owners — of course — were in contact with him to see if he could
              still work for them while he was dealing with the aftermath of his bullshit. John — another writer on the staff of the publication — had contact with him as well. Seemed that while Kevin was not going to see any jail time, he was
              technically on probation for domestic violence and — as a result — not able to have any guns in his possession.</p>
            <p name="8b3e" id="8b3e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So John — a kinda delusional nut-job in his own right — got to be the guy who held onto Kevin’s guns until the whole episode blew over. This was weird because we never really
              thought of Kevin as someone who owned guns, but he did; I guess he was one of those “Every Jew a .22” JDL loons. And we knew that John owned a gun, but he was one of those guys who never really wanted to know owned a gun; he was
              delusional repressed and violent.</p>
            <p name="b020" id="b020" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">So that’s that. After a few months, Kevin’s probation was over, he was divorced, got his guns back and life went back to normal in the world of the wack weekly
              newspaper.</p>
