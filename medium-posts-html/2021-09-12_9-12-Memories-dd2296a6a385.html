            <p name="b7f5" id="b7f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The day after 9–11 was oddly calm and quiet. Everyone was in the same boat. Everyone was bonded in that crazy way only disaster could bring people together.</p>
            <p name="e225" id="e225" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Around this time 20 years ago, I would’ve been on a Coney Island bound F train headed to 7th Ave. in Park Slope.</p>
            <p name="1a53" id="1a53" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Former Onion colleagues who all lived around the same general area of 8th Ave. and 10th St. in Park Slope — and a couple in Windsor Terrace — were gathering for a morning after
              9–11 brunch.</p>
            <p name="a956" id="a956" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">And I was invited to join them.</p>

          <div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn">
            <p name="b4d5" id="b4d5" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">The brunch was at Dizzy’s Diner on 9th St. and 8th Ave. I got on the F train at Bergen St. near Boerum Hill, where I lived at the time, to head over.</p>
            <p name="9305" id="9305" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The trains ran fine. The F train line ran nowhere near Lower Manhattan so it was not affected by anything related to 9–11.</p>
            <p name="c917" id="c917" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I got on the F train and sat down. Maybe 4 or 5 people were in my car. We all sat there stunned in our own ways.</p>
            <p name="17b3" id="17b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Right across from me was some subway poster for continuing education programs at NYU. People walking around Greenwich Village with the WTC in the background.</p>
            <p name="ab2f" id="ab2f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I stared at that poster and the bright morning sun coming through the Windows as the train emerged from Carroll St. and headed towards the Smith-9th St. station.</p>
            <p name="234a" id="234a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then waited as the train headed to the 4th Ave.-9th St. station.</p>
            <p name="c4b0" id="c4b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Then finally the 7th Ave. station.</p>

          <div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn">
            <p name="acdc" id="acdc" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Got off the train and strolled up 9th St. and headed inside.</p>
            <p name="010e" id="010e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Onion crew had taken over the whole front table of the place.</p>
            <p name="df2e" id="df2e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Greetings were made and then the usual stuff that happens at group brunches like that happened: The menus, the ordering, the chatting.</p>
            <p name="d67f" id="d67f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One former colleague — who shall remain nameless — casually mentioned how his girlfriend was on an F train headed into Manhattan when a WTC tower collapsed and how she felt the
              train shake, the lights went on and off and they then the train moved on.</p>
            <p name="b92f" id="b92f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Utter bullshit.</p>
            <p name="0ae9" id="0ae9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">First, the F train runs nowhere near the WTC site; it enters Manhattan past Canal St. at Rutgers St.</p>
            <p name="3537" id="3537" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Second, the most immediate train lines affected by the WTC attack 1 and 9 trains directly below the WTC site and the R trains nearby.</p>
            <p name="b947" id="b947" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I called him out on it: I bluntly said the F train runs nowhere near the WTC site. He dead stared me, ate some food and then the conversation changed.</p>
            <p name="1d5d" id="1d5d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At some point I mentioned I tried to walk into Manhattan over the Brooklyn Bridge and brought my digital camera along.</p>
            <p name="468b" id="468b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The dude heard that, and blurted out, “So you walked over to take pictures?” It was said in a condescending tone that implied I was just there to take pictures as a novelty.</p>
            <p name="a7ad" id="a7ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I let that just float in the air and let it fade away.</p>

            <p name="0f76" id="0f76" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Yeah, I took pictures. But I also attempted to get into Manhattan because I knew friends and family might have been there and wanted to help if I could.</p>
            <p name="c32a" id="c32a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But this narcissistic psycho putz makes up a story so he can be directly connected to the horrors of 9–11? Eff him.</p>
            <p name="00e1" id="00e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Onion’s 9–11 coverage was justifiably praised as being a pitch perfect reaction to the events of the day.</p>
            <p name="a1d8" id="a1d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">But for me, it will always be scarred by this one pathological liar deciding to fabricate a false story to personally insert themselves into the 9–11 experience.
