            <p name="9509" id="9509" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">David was this rich kid who lived in Manhattan Beach. I knew him in junior high school. Maybe “rich” isn’t the best word to describe the kid. Maybe “entitled” is a better
              description of who he was and possibly still is. But compared to the kids from Brighton Beach, kids in Manhattan Beach were fairly rich and entitled across the board.</p>
            <p name="8589" id="8589" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To understand the politics of the situation, the junior high school we went to straddled the border between Manhattan Beach and Brighton Beach near the edge of Sheepshead Bay.
              While Brighton Beach was filled with pre-war tenements, ratty single family homes and even rattier bungalows that had no heat or hot water which were left-over from the time when the neighborhood was still a vacation destination
              community, Manhattan Beach was pretty much the closest thing to the “suburbs” I knew as a kid. The lawns were clean, people owned nice cars — as well as garages to put them in — and generally the neighborhood seemed cleaner and more
              “normal” than anything one would see in Brighton Beach. And junior high school was the place where — thanks to NYC Board of Education zoning as well as the “gifted and talented” program — some kids from Brighton Beach got to mingle with
              the kids from Manhattan Beach.</p>
            <p name="4231" id="4231" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now back to David.</p>
            <p name="cd24" id="cd24" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">David lived in Manhattan Beach and seemed to always be wearing the cleanest, hippest, preppiest clothes money could buy. The first time I ever saw an Izod Lacoste embroidered
              alligator logo on a piece of clothing was on a pristinely clean sweater David was wearing. He was scruffy in an urban preppie kind of way, but also clean and pretty cool at times. One of the first open acts of kindness David bestowed on
              me and other kid from Brighton Beach when we first arrived at the school was giving us a mix-tape that featured songs like <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Buggles’</em> “Video Killed the Radio Star,” <em
                class="markup--em markup--p-em">OMD</em>’s “Enola Gay” as well as <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Sparks’</em> “This Town Ain’t Big Enough for Both of Us.”</p>
            <p name="5d55" id="5d55" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We soon found out why he was so cool and generous: His brother worked for a major media company in the city and he would just get tons of stuff all the time from his brother.
              Stuff his brother was working on, stuff his brother was reviewing, stuff his brother was given as promotional swag just because. Just tons of stuff. And the stuff that wasn’t explicitly given to him he just had access to thanks to his
              position and connection to the entertainment world.</p>
            <p name="c275" id="c275" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, in 1982 when Eddie Murphy was starring in <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">48 Hrs.</em>, guess who showed off his bootleg copy of the film on Betamax to the
              class? David did. While few people owned VCRs back then this kid not only had access to a Betamax deck, he also had enough industry access to score a bootleg copy of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">48 Hrs.</em> in an era when movie
              bootlegging was far from common to say the least. He also was able to get his hands on a pre-release copy of the video game <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Berserk</em> for the Atari 2600 as well and show that off in class. The kid
              was well connected and sometimes us mere “commoners” benefited from his access to pop-culture bounty.</p>
            <p name="84cf" id="84cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And one spring day in 1983, a few of us <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em> fan classmates benefited from his access.</p>
            <p name="8a55" id="8a55" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On that day he showed up in our homeroom with a copy of the official Marvel comics adaptation of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Return of the Jedi</em> to share with us
              before the film was even officially released. For the first time in my life, the entire plot of a film I wanted to see was “spoiled.”</p>
            <p name="5f97" id="5f97" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We all eagerly huddled around a desk and gawked at the pictures and the story. Everyone soon learned that by the end of the film a new Death Star would be destroyed, Darth Vader
              would die and — for the first time in the series — Darth Vader would be unmasked so we could see what his real face actually looked like. Now granted, the Marvel comics adaptation creatively dodged any specific details of what Darth
              Vader’s real face actually looked like. So I could still look forward to being surprised by that little tidbit when I saw the movie on a big screen. But for all intents and purposes, the experience of seeing <em
                class="markup--em markup--p-em">Return of the Jedi</em> was now officially spoiled for me.</p>
            <p name="399c" id="399c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That said, I can’t blame David entirely for spoiling <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Return of the Jedi</em> by sharing that Marvel comics adaptation with everyone.</p>
            <p name="3f52" id="3f52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A short while later later — while I checked out magazines and comics at a local, dumpy, non-special newsstand — I spotted the exact same Marvel comics adaptation of <em
                class="markup--em markup--p-em">Return of the Jedi</em> up for sale a few weeks before the film was officially scheduled to be released. So I did what any eager <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em> fan would do: I bought
              it. And then a week or so after that, the official Marvel comics movie program for <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Return of the Jedi</em> was officially on sale as well at the same dumpy newsstand. So I bought that too.</p>
            <p name="f2ee" id="f2ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The thing I liked the most about <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em> and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Empire Strikes Back</em> was the way I discovered
              and initially experienced both films: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em> was the unexpected hit that came out of nowhere and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Empire Strikes Back</em> was the sequel that exceeded
              everyone’s expectations for a follow-up film. Both films surprised fans in some unique way and never felt over marketed for what they were. In contrast, the marketing push around the release of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Return
                of the Jedi</em> seemed crass, arrogant and well coordinated.</p>
            <p name="9aa6" id="9aa6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I mean yes, this was still <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em> we’re talking about. So you could buy all kinds of books, toys, cards, action figures, souvenirs and
              junk to satisfy your fan desires if you wanted to. But despite the monumental success of both <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em> films, from my childhood perspective it never seemed like there was a big — or very well
              coordinated — merchandising push behind the first two <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em> films. Or at least a merchandising push that was so intensely well coordinated that the full, uncensored plot of an unreleased film
              could be deliberately made for sale in a legally purchasable form weeks before the actual film itself even hit theaters and that was somehow okay.</p>
            <p name="06ea" id="06ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With that said, my personal enjoyment of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em> ended with <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Return of the Jedi</em> and the
              pre-Internet media over-saturation I experienced during that film’s initial release. Part of me wants to blame David for sharing his copy of the official Marvel comics adaptation of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Return of the
                Jedi</em> with everyone else in our junior high school class. But — when all is said and done — by the time 1983 rolled around <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em> was no longer a magically unique, nascent series of
              science fiction films that inspired wonder and amazement. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em> had officially transformed itself into a Hollywood cash cow franchise whose only job was to crassly push viewer’s emotional
              buttons and sell them merchandise.</p>
            <p name="6d68" id="6d68" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">And if I could walk to a crappy corner newsstand and learn what the plot of an upcoming major film was before even seeing it, I was simply getting too old for that
              sort of thing.</p>
