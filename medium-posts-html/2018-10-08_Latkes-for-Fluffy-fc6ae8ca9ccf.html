            <p name="4232" id="4232" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">While our family didn’t formally eat meals like a family, eating food and making food was a constant thing around the home.</p>
            <p name="2e78" id="2e78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Seemingly each weekend during my childhood in the 1970s, my mom and dad would buy a huge bag of potatoes and a huge bag of onions and just make a huge pile of latkes; also known
              as potato pancakes.</p>
            <p name="afce" id="afce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am not exaggerating when I say that past take out pizza, there was rarely any other food to eat in the house on weekends other than latkes. Maybe some salisbury steak or some
              leftover chicken and a baked potato would be up for grabs. But in in general latkes — or maybe sometimes a pile of cheese blintzes — would be the centerpiece food of the household on the weekends.</p>
            <p name="e9a4" id="e9a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Sometimes my parents would make latkes in anticipation of visitors coming by. Other times they would make latkes because there was a good deal on sacks of potatoes
              or onions at a local market. But in general, making latkes was a weekend tradition that I miss as an adult but grew a bit sick of as a kid.</p>

          <div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn">
            <p name="37bd" id="37bd" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">When I woke up in the morning, I would be offered latkes for breakfast. When I came home from playing outside, I would be offered latkes lunch. When I was getting ready to go to
              sleep at night, I would be offered latkes for dinner. If friends came over? They were offered latkes whether they liked them or not.</p>
            <p name="ff8d" id="ff8d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If latkes were gold, my family would be rich.</p>
            <p name="0e78" id="0e78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now don’t get me wrong! I liked latkes. They were delicious, they were plentiful and they were seemingly in endless supply in our home. It was just I was sick and tired of them.
            </p>
            <p name="4797" id="4797" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some days when they were offered I would say, “No!” and would be met with indignation. My parents would often then talk to each other in Yiddish, Hebrew or Polish about my
              refusal of Latkes as if I were on drugs or something. My refusal of their fried potato pancakes would result in a pile of passive aggressive manipulation that sometimes was worse than overeating the latkes themselves.</p>
            <p name="057e" id="057e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So one day, instead of bluntly saying “No!” to my parents and causing unwanted drama and bullshit, I decided to say “Yes!” to them when latkes were offered.</p>
            <p name="3ed6" id="3ed6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They would then happily bring them over to my room, place them on my desk, I would sit down, take a bite of one or two of them, wait for them to leave, close the door, open the
              window and then toss them out into the building’s airway to Fluffy, the super’s dog who hung out in that airway all day.</p>
            <p name="8661" id="8661" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Fluffy was a cool dog and really liked to eat those latkes. It even got to the point where Fluffy could almost predict she would be fed latkes at certain times on certain days on
              the weekend and would — in anticipation — look up at my window and wait for them to be tossed down to her.</p>
            <p name="c8c7" id="c8c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This “tossing latkes to a dog” scheme worked well for a few weekends until one day Johnny came up to our apartment — seemingly for no reason — and asked to talk to my dad in
              private.</p>
            <p name="7cda" id="7cda" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It turns out that around the same time I started to toss the latkes out the window, Fluffy was getting sick and Johnny couldn’t figure out why. Turns out that fried potato
              pancakes might taste good, but aren’t good for dogs. Too much gpotatoes, grease and flour in one lump I guess.</p>
            <p name="531a" id="531a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And after talking to my dad, Johnny and my dad walked over to my room, knocked on the door, opened it up and said, “Jack you can’t throw the latkes out the window anymore.”
              Johnny stood next to him and chimed in an basically said the same adding, “Fluffy gets sick from them! And your mom and dad work all day making them so you can eat them!”</p>
            <p name="630e" id="630e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I apologized to Johnny and agreed to never toss latkes out the window to Fluffy ever again. Then I sat there and watched as Johnny left our apartment with a small
              pile of latkes wrapped in aluminum foil in his hand and headed out the front door.</p>
