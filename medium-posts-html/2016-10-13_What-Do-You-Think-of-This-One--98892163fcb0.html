            <p name="7bae" id="7bae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The first time I saw <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em> was in the NYC Department of Parks and Recreation day camp that was run out of P.S. 100 in Trump Village.
              The counsellors there were just neighborhood high school kids and part of our “summer camp experience” — along with playing in the same exact playgrounds we already had free access to — was being taken on buses to see movies as a group.
            </p>
            <p name="6a68" id="6a68" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since it was the 1970s they took us to any science fiction — or even light horror — film was out in theaters at the time. I saw <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Godzilla
                versus Megalon</em> (the one with Jet Jaguar) at the Trump Village Theater, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Squirm</em> (the movie about killer worms) at the Benson Theater in Bensonhurst, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">King
                Kong</em> (the version at the World Trade Center) at the Alpine in Bay Ridge, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Bug</em> (the one about killer cockroaches) at the Trump Village Theater. All of those films sucked for different
              reasons; the list of literal crap we saw was endless. But seeing <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em> was different experience from the get go.</p>
            <p name="b501" id="b501" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">First, we were going to Manhattan to see the film which was out of the norm to say the least. All of the other films we saw were at dumpy Brooklyn theaters which were on their
              way to be closed or turned into a multiplex. To see <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em> we had to go to the only theater in the city that was showing it at the time: The Loews Astor Plaza in Times Square.</p>
            <p name="bee5" id="bee5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We all got into the yellow school buses, headed to Manhattan and were dropped off in front of the theater in Times Square. It was a sunny, spring day and camp counsellors lined
              us up under the marquee while they got the tickets from the box office. Then they let us goof around and hang out in the alleyway next to the theater between 44th and 45th Street while we all waited for the theater to open. It was
              clearly the first showing of the day.</p>
            <p name="86d1" id="86d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the alleyway, everyone gravitated to their own groups as usual. I sat down with this kid named Rob. We got along because we were both oddballs that didn’t live in Trump
              Village like the rest of the kids yet still went to the day camp run out of Trump Village.</p>
            <p name="eb8c" id="eb8c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With our backs pressed against the alley wall and our knees folded, we both stared intently at the lobby cards in the glass display case just outside the theater door. The lobby
              cards were stacked in the display case with no particular magic, rhyme or reason; they were just pictures of scenes from <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em> with a nice border of tinsel or glitter around them. One shot
              showed the first appearance of Darth Vader at the beginning of the film; standing there with hands on his hips, surrounded by dead bodies after just boarding the captured Rebel ship.</p>
            <p name="eeac" id="eeac" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“What do you think of this one?” I asked Rob, motioning to the lobby cards. “I don’t know.” He shrugged. The thing with these movie “field trips” was
              that if the movie stank — and a lot of them stank — it basically meant about 90 minutes of time in the dark dealing with bullies and horsing around. So I kept on looking at the lobby cards — trying to figure out what the film was
              about — and waited.</p>
            <p name="d092" id="d092" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A counsellor clapped his hands and shouted, “Okay! Everybody! Line up!” And we did while the theater staff unlocked the entrance doors. We filed into the theater lobby through
              the noticeably awkward alley entrance which didn’t seem like anything special. But the second we walked into the theater itself, everything was clearly different: The theater was huge! Easily the largest theater I had ever been in and
              my previous benchmark was the Oceana in Brighton Beach where I saw <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Bad News Bears</em>before they chopped it up into a multiplex.</p>
            <p name="64e6" id="64e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We all walked down the aisle on the left-hand side of the theater and piled into two or three rows near the middle of the left side of the theater. There were some other people
              there, but not many.</p>
            <p name="0a4c" id="0a4c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Everyone sat down and the typical horsing around and bullshit happened. The kids who had enough money to buy soda and candy, had their candy and showed it off by tossing bits of
              it at the poorer kids like me. Chairs were kicked, people were shoved and some were even punched. Then the curtains were slowly pulled back and the lights dimmed.</p>
            <p name="2d7a" id="2d7a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The screen was easily the biggest screen I ever saw in my young life; which made sense since the theater itself was so huge. But still the impact of actually seeing that screen
              light up was tremendous.</p>
            <p name="d534" id="d534" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Before the movie started — but while the screen was lit up with a trailer, teaser or something — there was still some horsing around happening. That horsing around continued a
              bit during the 20th Century Fox opening fanfare. But when the main titles hit — with the big “Lucasfilm Limited” in green letters — the tone changed. Everyone’s eyes were fixed on the screen.</p>
            <p name="b156" id="b156" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then when the huge, yellow “Star Wars” text blew onto the screen followed by the opening crawl absolutely everyone was into it and sat still. This was literally the first film
              where everyone — kids and counsellors — shut up and paid attention to the film right from the outset. Then when the film actually began and the tiny rebel ship was being chased by the gigantic Star Destroyer that filled the whole
              screen, that settled it. Everyone was 1,000,000% into the film.</p>
            <p name="cb3e" id="cb3e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When the movie ended it was an amazing testament to the power of myth and magic that 100% nobody was getting harassed or beaten up — or harassing and beating other people
              up — and everyone was fairly stunned and talking enthusiastically about the film. The film made everyone forget how to be jerks for a while.</p>
            <p name="2688" id="2688" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As we left the theater, the first thing I noticed were some arcade games tucked in a corner. I loved arcade games and they were always on my radar. These were some tank or combat
              inspired games since they had some weird controls. I ran over to check them out — as a counsellor yelled at me to get back in line — but they were unplugged or out of order. Dejected, I walked back in the line with everyone else and
              kept on walking. Soon we came near a table where everyone was hovering around and looking at something.</p>
            <p name="4f59" id="4f59" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was a crappy metal card table with a red cloth thrown over that had some copies of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em> movie programs strewn across it for sale.
              There was some theater worker wearing an official vest with his name tag on it awkwardly standing behind the table waiting for us kids to give him our money. There was a metal cash box near him filled with bills and change.</p>
            <p name="1a3d" id="1a3d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I never saw a movie program before. These specifically were about the size of a record album. I think they were being sold for something like $4 a piece and had some cool
              pictures from the film in them which was a big deal. In those days cable TV didn’t exist and video rental stores — let alone VCRs — were not commonplace. So if you wanted to remember a movie after you saw it, pictures printed on paper
              in something you bought was the way you did that. But for a kid like me $4 was two weeks’ worth of allowance and I only had about a dollar and some change on me. So I had to pass. Predictably, the same richer kids who could afford soda
              and candy got programs and were pretty selfish and arrogant about it. So I wouldn’t be able to ask any of them to borrow a copy of their program to flip through on the bus ride back home. I didn’t float in their social groups and that
              was the end of that.</p>
            <p name="b2b0" id="b2b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When we left the theater, the sun on the street was bright and there was another table out on the sidewalk with more stuff for sale. It didn’t seem like an official sanctioned
              souvenir stand, but just something some fans decided to do on a whim. The table itself was yet another crappy card table, but I remember it being covered with a gingham tablecloth and filled with buttons and metal jewelry inspired by
              <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em>. The guy behind the table looked like a hippie, but was a bit cleaner. Some of the stuff he was selling looked cool, but nothing really appealed to me. So I got back on the bus with
              everyone else, grabbed a window seat and we all headed back to Brooklyn.</p>
            <p name="00a9" id="00a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I got home, I was really excited to tell dad about <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em>. He knew about the film since it was making some small buzz on the
              news. From that day forward, anytime he caught something on TV that showed scenes from <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em> — even if it was just a commercial — he let me know so I could run into the living room to see it.
            </p>
            <p name="3d32" id="3d32" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The next day wasn’t a camp day; maybe it was the weekend? Anyway, on one of my trips to the corner newsstand to check out comics I remember seeing packs of <em
                class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em> bubble gum trading cards for 25 cents a piece. I could afford that! So instead of buying a comic, I got two packs of trading cards for 50 cents.</p>
            <p name="ae53" id="ae53" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The gum was horrible, but the pictures and stickers brought back memories.</p>
