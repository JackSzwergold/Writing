            <p name="70f3" id="70f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Back in the day you had to drag your ass to an actual theater to see a movie again. In those days before VCRs and cable TV were commonplace there simply wasn’t any other choice
              for most people if you enjoyed a film and wanted to take in the experience again.</p>
            <p name="8e3a" id="8e3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I mean, going to a theater to see a movie again wasn’t a completely new idea to me or anyone else. Personally, I sat through two back-to-back screenings of <em
                class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Muppet Movie</em> and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Superman II</em> in the same day, in the same theater, because I liked each of those films that much. And when <em
                class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Empire Strikes Back</em> was re-released in theaters in 1981 — after it’s initial 1980 release — I was quite happy to pay full-price to be able see it again.</p>
            <p name="1a46" id="1a46" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But with <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Return of the Jedi</em> I went to see it again a week later in the same exact theater not because I liked it the first time I saw it.
              Not at all; in fact I hated it. But rather because I simply had no idea <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">why</em> I hated it so much. And I needed some closure to the issue.</p>
            <p name="970f" id="970f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The deal was I invested a lot of my young life into giving a shit about <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em>. And while I didn’t own every single piece of <em
                class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em> memorabilia or toys — or even go to conventions — I did own a lot of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em> related stuff. Like piles of <em
                class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em> Topps trading cards, Kenner action figures and Marvel comics. And I scoured the local used bookstore’s used comics bin for pretty much any ragged copy of the <em
                class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em> comic I could find. I mean I never even read those crappy comics, but I at least needed to purchase and possess something with the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em>
              logo/name on it to sate my desire for new stuff in between films, right? Heck, I even special ordered Alan Dean Foster’s 1978 <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Splinter of the Mind’s Eye</em> novel just so I could get a brand new
              copy; not a ragged used copy or a reject copy with the cover ripped off.</p>
            <p name="75ef" id="75ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anyway, when I overheard two other junior high school friends of mine — who didn’t see the film on it’s opening weekend — making plans to see it the following weekend, I asked to
              join them. “But you already saw it, right?” one of them said. “Yeah, but I want to see it again.” And with that said and done, I was all set to see <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Return of the Jedi</em> one more time.</p>
            <p name="e696" id="e696" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We all showed up at the Kingsway — the same place I saw it in the first time — on Saturday morning. But unlike the first time a week earlier, there was a fairly huge line in
              front of the Kingsway that snaked around the block. “Shit!” I said as we tried to find where the end of the line was. Luckily the end of the line wasn’t too far back and was just around the corner of Kings Highway and East 10th Street.
              “Okay, here we are,” I said. “And now what?” a friend said. “Well, we wait.” And so we waited.</p>
            <p name="eae5" id="eae5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I had brought along my copy of the official Marvel comics movie program for <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Return of the Jedi</em> so I flipped through it while we waited in
              line. It seems like I was desperate to find meaning in <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Return of the Jedi</em> because I pored over the same exact program before I saw the film for the first time a week or so earlier. And now I was
              poring over it yet again while I waited in line to see <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Return of the Jedi</em> yet again despite the fact that the actual movie itself would be screening before my eyes in the next 30 to 45 minutes
              anyway. Was it a sign of boredom or desperation to know why <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Return of the Jedi</em> didn’t resonate with me the way the other two <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em> films did? Who
              knows exactly. But I was definitely fixated on trying to squeeze some meaning out of this final film in the original <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em> trilogy.</p>
            <p name="c3bd" id="c3bd" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Jack!” a friend said. “We’re going to Crazy Eddie’s to check out records. We’ll be back.” “Okay, but don’t take too long,” I responded. And with that
              I was holding our collective places in line while they went off record shopping.</p>
            <p name="049c" id="049c" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Hey, can I see that?” said some guy behind me. He was a lot taller than me, slightly older than me and seemed nice enough so I obliged. He started to
              flip through the program and would occasionally quip about this, that or the other to his girlfriend. She was clearly bored as hell but then lit up the second she saw a picture of an Ewok in the program. “What is that?” she said with a
              thick, Bensonhurst Brooklyn accent. Me and he boyfriend both responded, “Ewok…” at the same time; except he read it out of the program and I recited the name from memory. “How did you know that?” the guy said to me. “Well, what else
              would it be?” And we both shrugged.</p>
            <p name="8e44" id="8e44" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Soon after that the line started to move, but my friends were nowhere in sight. I got a bit nervous so I nervoiusly asked the guy for my program back. “Wait a sec… Hang on…” he
              said, clearly being a dick about giving it back to me. So I persisted and soon he was glowering at me, closed the program, tightly rolled it up in his hands and then handed it back to me. “Thanks!” I said to him as I nervously took the
              program and started to unroll and flatten the program out again. Just then my friends came back to show off their haul.</p>
            <p name="d4e4" id="d4e4" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Hey! What did you get?” and they both showed me their modest purchases of the day. One of them bought a 45 single of <em
                class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Pretenders’</em> “Back on the Chain Gang” and the other bought a 45 single of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Culture Club’</em> “Time.” I looked the 45s over, handed them back, shrugged and
              said, “Okay…” as the line moved forward towards the box office window.</p>
            <p name="2fbe" id="2fbe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Within a few minutes we were all in the same exact balcony theater in pretty much the same exact area I saw it the first time; near the left, center side. And that wasn’t the
              only thing that was the same: Just as the first time, the crowd was noisy and the theater was filled with kids who were just too young to be in the theater to begin with.</p>
            <p name="501a" id="501a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Past any of that theater crowd stuff, my feelings about each scene in the film itself were pretty much the same; nothing really resonated with me at best or just came off as
              hokey at worse. The only real difference this time around is I noticed some visibly sloppy special effects moments. Like when Han Solo and Lando Calrissian were standing in a hangar talking about the Millennium Falcon; that very
              specific shot looked really stiff, badly composed and the matte painting background of the hangar stood out like a sore thumb. I also noticed that one bit where the two T.I.E. fighters seemed to appear out of nowhere during the final
              Death Star battle just after that stupid lobster guy (Admiral Ackbar) shouted “It’s a trap!” But past being able to nitpick those kind of aesthetic details, the film itself still fell flat and seemed excessively childish to me.</p>
            <p name="0f9f" id="0f9f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When the film finally ended and the credits began to roll we all stood up to leave. Walking down the aisle one friend simply said, “Well, that wasn’t that very good.” And nobody
              disagreed.</p>
            <p name="fe2f" id="fe2f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Outside of the theater, we all decided to take the B68 bus back to Brighton Beach since it was already at the Kings Highway stop and we knew it would be an air conditioned ride
              home on a hot spring day. We all got in, talked about the film and other stuff — like copying computer games — and then each got off at our respective stops.</p>
            <p name="577b" id="577b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As the bus got near my stop I stood up, rang the bell, said goodbye and hopped out the back door. It wasn’t too late in the afternoon so I grabbed a slice of pizza from Rocco’s,
              walked around the corner and headed back home. My dad was sitting outside the building in a folding chair reading the newspaper with all of the other folks from the building who seemed to only sit in front of the building all day.</p>
            <p name="56cf" id="56cf" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing">“So how was it?” he asked? I shrugged and said, “Ehhh…” while taking another bite of my slice and leaning back to sit on the small
              brick front yard fence in front of the building. My dad saw the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Return of the Jedi</em> program under my arm and asked to look at it. I passed it over to him and he flipped through it for a bit. Then
              I looked at my watch, noticed the time and said I was going upstairs. My dad held onto the program for the rest of the afternoon while he hung out in front of the building as I headed upstairs to put on some music, play some computer
              games and then take a nap.</p>
