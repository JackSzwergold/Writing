            <p name="8e2d" id="8e2d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Honestly not too sure when exactly it happened. Pretty sure I was 10 or 11 years old at the time which would have placed this all happening during the holiday season of of
              1978 or 1979. Regardless, it happened during Hanukkah with the extended family in Eastchester.</p>
            <p name="efb7" id="efb7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Nobody in my direct family was from Eastchester, but my brother’s in-laws lived in Eastchester. And since my parents really never did anything big for
              Hanukkah — or any of the holidays actually — the in-law’s Hanukkah celebration ended up being the de-facto “big” and supposedly “proper” celebration in the family despite my mom and dad (and me) not really liking the celebration or the
              in-laws.</p>
          </div>

      <section name="7b6a" class="section section--body">

          <hr class="section-divider">
        </div>
        <div class="section-content">
          <div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn">
            <p name="6c0c" id="6c0c" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Despite all of the classic jokes and tropes about in-laws, one might not understand why anyone wouldn’t like these particular in-laws. What was not to like? The husband was a
              baker and the wife was a housewife and after working and toiling in the old — and predominantly German — part of Washington Heights for years they finally “retired” to some condo in Eastchester in their later years. Kinda typical
              Eastern European life path at the time.</p>
            <p name="6ffe" id="6ffe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But the the larger — and more ethnically specific — deal was that my parents were working class Jewish-Polish immigrants. And these in-laws were middle-class and Jewish-German.
              The differences might be subtle to some — and that even simplifies it a lot — but there was a lot of implicit, and sometimes explicit, class related bigotry and elitism at play in the way the in-laws interacted with my family.</p>
            <p name="e1f6" id="e1f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">And one should also know that everyone — my parents and my brother’s in-laws — were Holocaust survivors. And to outsiders that might mean they shared a common bond
              through a common tragedy but they honestly didn’t. They didn’t like each other; the in-laws in a somewhat slick, passive-aggressive and entitled middle-class way and my parents in a more direct no-nonsense working class way.</p>

          <div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn">
            <p name="45a2" id="45a2" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">A year or so before this incident happened, my mom and dad both — for all intents and purposes — declared they were sick of these in-law hosted celebrations. Phrases like
              “entitled” or “privileged” really didn’t exist in common language back then. And even if they did my parents weren’t fluent enough in English to use them. But based on the arguments I would hear them engage my brother in on the
              phone — and sometimes in person — that’s basically what their complaint about the in-laws was about.</p>
            <p name="df60" id="df60" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As for me, as a mere kid caught in the middle of all of this, I always saw the in-laws as “snotty” and “conceited.” During every visit I had with them I always felt like I was
              being treated as some kind of pitiful object that needed to be “rescued” or some kind of special case that they were attempting to rescue and rehabilitate.</p>
            <p name="5923" id="5923" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To be fair, most people treated me as if I was “weird” or “strange” as a kid since my parents were old and clearly immigrants; the WASPy world of American culture punishes those
              who don’t fit in that WASPy template.</p>
            <p name="5e00" id="5e00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But my brother’s in-law’s always knew how to “kick it up a notch” in their interactions; I always got the general sense they were patronizing me but I sucked it up and tolerated
              it since during the holidays I would get some decent money or gifts from them.</p>
            <p name="7b5a" id="7b5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">So back to the incident…</p>

          <div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn">
            <p name="74e5" id="74e5" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">By the time Hanukkah came around that year, my parents were hard-set on not going to any more of the in-laws celebrations no matter what.</p>
            <p name="016c" id="016c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My brother — as expected — went out of his way to chastise them for thinking and behaving that way, but I understood their point of view. Why go out of your way to have a
              supposedly “proper” Hanukkah celebration all the way up in Eastchester when the people who invited you were just snotty, judgmental and generally passive-aggressively nasty to the people they invited?</p>
            <p name="713c" id="713c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But I was a young kid and bit idealistic — and naive — at the time. I convinced my dad and mom that not going to the in-laws Hanukkah celebration was rude to my brother and
              generally not nice. Not nice to who? I dunno. But in general, to me — as a kid — it seemed not nice. And being nice was important, right?</p>
            <p name="3fcb" id="3fcb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">So that Hanukkah we all — in our own “grin and bear it” way — begrudgingly headed out to Eastchester to celebrate Hanukkah with the in-laws and make the best of
              it.</p>

          <div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn">
            <p name="065d" id="065d" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">When we all showed up everyone else was there already. The in-laws, my brother and his wife, some other miscellaneous family members I barely remember and — last but not
              least — there was Lieszel.</p>
            <p name="f7da" id="f7da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Lieszel was a family friend of the in-laws from their Washington Heights days and was — pretty much — a central casting example of a dowdy, middle-aged German housewife. She
              might have been a widower since I never met her husband or even knew if she had children. But in general, she was a stern-faced German-Jewish woman with a poofy blonde hairdo and a judgmental demeanor who showed up at these events and
              we had to deal with that.</p>
            <p name="9c90" id="9c90" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My side of the family was never really friendly to her, but not due to lack of trying! She was just this odd, stern creature at these “celebrations” we had to deal with because
              she was friends with the in-laws and we were just guests.</p>
            <p name="2a95" id="2a95" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now despite the negative picture I am painting at these events, sometimes there were brief moments of joy at these things. These moments would typically come once the majority of
              guests arrived and would end shortly before the real “celebration” (typically an overly formal dinner) would happen. The joy existed in the social cracks if you were lucky enough to experience them.</p>
            <p name="1e4d" id="1e4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">People would be just sitting around, talking laughing and joking. Sometimes snacking as well. These moments actually reminded me of the celebrations my family would have at our
              home, but without the stupid formal dinner that followed. My parents celebrations would basically center around a simple acknowledgement of the event, passing around gifts and well wishes, and then just basically hanging around and
              doing not much of anything. To me that is what a happy celebration is about; being together and not making a big deal out of things.</p>
            <p name="c836" id="c836" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So in the middle of one of these brief — and seemingly accidental — moments of joy in-law family-friend Lieszel inexplicably stood up from wherever she was was sitting and
              started to loudly sing, “Deutschland, Deutschland über alles, über alles in der Welt!” And then sit back down.</p>
            <p name="fb4d" id="fb4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For those who don’t know, “Deutschland Über Alles” was the — initially — innocuous German national anthem that was hijacked and perverted by the Nazis during World War II to
              shove national socialism down the throats of all. It was quickly dropped after World War II because of the unshakable Nazi connections.</p>
            <p name="b810" id="b810" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But despite of the very well known, negative Nazi-related associations, Lieszel decided to start singing the first stanza of this German anthem out of the blue during this family
              gathering.</p>
            <p name="a526" id="a526" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While I remember her standing up, singing that Nazi bullshit and then sitting down again, I also remember another thing: Nobody else said much of anything or even chastised her.
              I mean, my mom and dad instantly got upset at this bizarre outburst of German nationalism, but nobody else said anything.</p>
            <p name="1287" id="1287" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My parents basically flipped out and started to yell at my brother about it, but my brother didn’t think it was a big deal. Neither did his wife or his in-laws. The kids that
              were around — which consisted of me and my niece from my sister’s side — barely understood what just happened, but we knew it was weird so we were just stunned and silent.</p>
            <p name="f23d" id="f23d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After Lieszel sat down, my brother’s mother-in-law came over and started to whisper in German in Lieszel’s ear as they both looked around at us.</p>
            <p name="1e5e" id="1e5e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I might have been a kid at the time, but neither of them seemed to be too broken up about the incident despite the fact it was — frankly — pretty crazy. Not to mention that at no
              point did Lieszel look remorseful or even attempt to apologize. The look on her face reminded me of the stern and judgmental — and frankly shitty — elementary school teachers I dealt with growing up. But at least when it came to
              teachers, I could go home at the end of the day and not have to share a meal with them. Now somehow we all had to sit down and break bread with this unapologetic German loon.</p>
            <p name="9880" id="9880" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Needless to say, the fun and laughter was quickly sucked out of the room and we all just sat around and awkwardly waited for the holiday dinner to start.</p>
            <p name="db15" id="db15" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">In the case of Hanukkah, dinner started only after the Hanukkah Menorahs were lit. So when the Menorahs were brought out we all gathered around them, lit whatever
              Menorah we had to light and then sat down to have an awkward dinner.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="section-content">
          <div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn">
            <p name="f81e" id="f81e" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">To say the dinner was awkward was an understatement at best; the dinner was filled with pregnant pauses and awkward interactions. I don’t recall what we ate, but it was most
              likely some basic brisket, beans, sweet potatoes and other forgettable things like that.</p>
            <p name="3cbd" id="3cbd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And honestly, while I sometimes enjoyed the brisket the in-laws made, the “Deutschland Über Alles” opening act I was forced to experience that day kind of ruined the meal for me.
            </p>
            <p name="8ac0" id="8ac0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After dinner, the kids would get up from the dinner table play Dreidel or some bullshit like that and wait for gifts to come out. If we were lucky, my brother’s father-in-law
              would turn on the TV so we could just sit and stare at whatever was on TV until it was time to go home.</p>
            <p name="efad" id="efad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And again, at no point did Lieszel apologize for her outburst despite the fact that it was pretty clear my mom and dad were still upset about it and still discussing it with my
              brother throughout the evening.</p>
            <p name="cf70" id="cf70" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It seemed like my brother thought it was no big deal and just thought our parents were overreacting to — what he perceived to be — a “minor” incident. I had watched my brother
              fight with our parents tons of times but this time it was different. Instead of defending his own parents against the bullying of others, he was clearly apologizing and defending the bully.</p>
            <p name="cde9" id="cde9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And while Lieszel deciding to sing “Deutschland Über Alles” was one thing, the reaction — or lack of reaction — of others in the family was another.</p>
            <p name="d455" id="d455" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That specific Hanukkah, the Hanukkah I went out of my way to insist that my parents put aside their differences with the in-laws to celebrate the holiday as a family, ended up
              being the one where this crazy bullshit happened.</p>
            <p name="f15f" id="f15f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And my brother had nothing to say about it past claiming my parents were overreacting to it all and it was no big deal.</p>
            <p name="de36" id="de36" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Saying my brother’s behavior was a betrayal of his own direct family seems too simple. Calling it gaslighting would also be too cut and dry. But from that moment on I was able to
              fully understand why my parents disliked their in-laws and didn’t want to deal with them: These people were just classist bigots in their own genteel, European way. And my brother was simply accepting, excusing and normalizing this
              behavior for little to no good reason other than he married into this other family.</p>
            <p name="15a2" id="15a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">And I was just 10 or 11 years old at the time when I came to this sad realization.</p>
