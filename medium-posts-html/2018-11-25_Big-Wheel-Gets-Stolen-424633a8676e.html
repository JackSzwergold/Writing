              <figcaption class="imageCaption">Looking down the alley to where I rescued my Big Wheel from the sons of a drug dealer who lived in a shack behind this building in the 1970s. The alley has definitely been redone since the way I remember
                it back in the day. (Photo by Jack Szwergold; Taken November 24, 2018)</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p name="d13d" id="d13d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I was 1978 or 1978 and I was 10 or 11 years old. A little bit vague on the exact year and age, but whatever the year was or my age was, I was definitely aware of the fact I
              was too old to ride my Big Wheel around the block. But I still did because I liked to do it.</p>
            <p name="a9a5" id="a9a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yeah, I might have caught myself in the reflection of the windows of Speedway Drugs as I scooted around and realized I looked slightly ridiculous, but I didn’t care. I liked
              riding that Big Wheel.</p>
            <p name="5bd3" id="5bd3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One weekend while riding it around the block, I rode it around to the corner of Ocean Parkway and Brighton Beach Avenue and ran into the neighborhood drug dealer and his kids.
              That description makes it sound so ominous; “drug dealer.” And from my perspective as a young kid, he was definitely a drug dealer and a bookie. But he wasn’t any kind of big deal guy doing shady stuff you wanted to rub the wrong way.
              He was just poor and kinda sketchy guy who did what he did to get by.</p>
            <p name="7771" id="7771" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anyway, his two kids saw me on my Big Wheel and cornered me right near subway entrance. They wanted to ride the Big Wheel and at first I said “No…” but after a few back and forth
              rounds, I caved in and said “Yes.” They were both smaller and younger than me so I didn’t feel like I was being bullied or anything like that.</p>
            <p name="699d" id="699d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I stood up and got out of the seat and one of them immediately sat down to pedal it and the jumped on the back and stood up right behind as they rode that beat up Big Wheel
              all the way down the block. Past my building, past the other buildings and all the down to where the oddball private homes were and then they made a right down a driveway.</p>
            <p name="fc67" id="fc67" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Don’t worry!” their dad said, “They’ll bring it back.” So I walked back to the front of my building and played around with whatever kids were around.
            </p>
            <p name="a1c8" id="a1c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After about an hour or so the sun was setting and the church bells were ringing and I was getting concerned. I walked down the block to see if I could see anything down the alley
              they went into.</p>
            <p name="5e5f" id="5e5f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As I walked down the block, I ran into Howie and told him what happened. “Sounds like they stole it,” he said pretty matter-of-factly. Which when I heard those words said out
              loud, I began to accept as the truth. At least the truth that existed in my young kid’s head at the time.</p>
            <p name="6ce7" id="6ce7" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“So what can I do?” I asked Howie. He shrugged and didn’t know and neither did I. So I suggested we just walk to the house where their driveway was
              and think it out.</p>
            <p name="68fd" id="68fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The house was odd and had a somewhat “haunted” — but cool — look about it in that semi-abandoned house sorta way. I knew that one half of the house — the right side — was either
              owned by or rented out to some Orthodox Jewish family because occasionally my mom would go there and I would tag along. Those Orthodox kids always looked pasty skinned and would react weirdly to some of the toys and things I would talk
              about.</p>
            <p name="642e" id="642e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The other side of the house was the really weirder part of the equation.</p>
            <p name="a09e" id="a09e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The front yard was overgrown but oddly beautiful. Lots of lilacs and other flowers. You’d always hear sparrows chirping or see bees buzzing around the yard on any spring day. But
              all we knew about who owned it was that there was some old lady on the top floor who would flip out and start shouting gibberish sprinkled with curses if kids played near the driveway facing her windows. And if her crazy babbling old
              lady nonsense didn’t scare the kids away, she always seemed to have a bucket of water — at least we all hoped it was water — ready to toss on the kids to get them to leave the driveway.</p>
            <p name="6921" id="6921" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So knowing that, Howie and I approached that driveway as carefully as we could. The old lady’s corner window was opened up, but she was nowhere to be seen. Still, she was a risk
              to us kids. So we had to devise a plan.</p>
            <p name="5426" id="5426" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A friend of Howie’s showed up as we were thinking up a plan. “What are you doing?” he asked and we explained the whole situation to him. After a while I devised a brilliant plan:
              The drug dealer and his kids lived in some kind of shack — or modified garage — behind the house. One of us would run down the driveway, head to their shack, grab the Big Wheel and run back out.</p>
            <p name="0618" id="0618" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I’ll stay out here,” said Howie. And his friend agreed. So I guess I was the one who was going to run down the driveway.</p>
            <p name="328d" id="328d" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Well, you guys have to distract her from me when I run down there,” I said. And they nodded in agreement when they suddenly looked up: The old lady
              appeared in the window and started shouting at us as she looked at us.</p>
            <p name="770e" id="770e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Seeing that I just shrugged, and just ran straight down the driveway. She noticed me and panicked and shouted a very clear “What!?!” as Howie and his friend tried to distract her
              from me.</p>
            <p name="af4b" id="af4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was more than half way down the alley in no time, and slowed down a bit. I could hear the old lady and Howie and his friend shout and scream behind me, but that wasn’t my
              concern at that moment. As I moved close to the way and slowly walked down the last few steps of the driveway, that’s when I saw it: The Big Wheel itself.</p>
            <p name="1b90" id="1b90" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was in good shape and sitting just outside of the swung open wooden door of the shack they all lived in. While nobody — except that old lady — saw me sneaking up, to get the
              Big Wheel I needed to basically run in front of that open door, grab it and get out.</p>
            <p name="b26d" id="b26d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I took a few deep breaths, walked slowly towards the Big Wheel, grabbed it by the handles, and quickly peeked into the shack they all lived in as I pushed it towards the
              driveway. I could see the kids and I saw what looked like a sheet draped over a bed or couch. The kids didn’t initially notice me, but the second I grabbed the Big Wheel, the kids turned around, saw me and shouted “Hey!” so I stopped
              rolling it and picked it up by the front fork and started running back down the alley.</p>
            <p name="8b32" id="8b32" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I could hear the kids shouting as they chased after me, but was more worried about what was in front of me: That screaming old lady. Howie and his friend saw me and shouted at
              me, “Okay! Come on!” and all that.</p>
            <p name="1893" id="1893" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The old lady turned her head to see me running down the driveway and just exclaimed, “Oh!?!” paused, ducked inside and then we knew that bucket full of water or whatever the hell
              she had was going to come flying out that window at any moment.</p>
            <p name="ab1b" id="ab1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Knowing that, I ran harder with the kids behind me trying to catch up. Just as I got past the area beneath the old lady’s window, I could hear the sound of a bucket of liquid
              being dumped. It smacked straight onto the ground behind me and thankfully missed me. But the splash did manage to stop those kids right in their tracks.</p>
            <p name="1c4a" id="1c4a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Once I got to the sidewalk, I high fived Howie and his friend and we all started to make a beeline down the block. By then a few older people and other miscellaneous adults came
              around to see what the commotion was about.</p>
            <p name="ae54" id="ae54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With the coast being pretty much clear, I got onto the Big Wheel, waved back to Howie and his friend and just rode it straight back to my building.</p>
            <p name="c22c" id="c22c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My dad was in front of the building sitting in a folding chair and asked, “What happened?” and I looked at him and said “Nothing!” as I got off of the Big Wheel, rolled it to the
              lobby of the building and got my mom to buzz me in.</p>
            <p name="e597" id="e597" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was 1978 or 1978 and I was 10 or 11 years old. A little bit vague on the exact year and age, but whatever the year was or my age was, I was definitely aware of the fact I was
