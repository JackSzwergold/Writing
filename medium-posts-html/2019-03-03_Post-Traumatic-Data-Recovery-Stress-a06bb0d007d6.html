            <p name="fac4" id="fac4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">It was a spring or summerish day in the late 1990s. I would guess it was 1999 or so. And for the record, all of this happened over the span of 15 to 20 minutes or so; so
              hey.</p>
            <p name="a2df" id="a2df" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was working my day at the wacky weekly newspaper place and found out a former staffer (Danny) was visiting.</p>
            <p name="e57a" id="e57a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Danny was a writer and editor in the pre-fame days of the wacky weekly newspaper when it was mainly a college focused beer and pizza rag with jokes to match. Nowadays the
              newspaper still thrived off of ad revenue from pizza and beer places but the content was far more sophisticated and focused to a national audience.</p>
            <p name="29ea" id="29ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But that is no disrespect to Danny: He is the one who pioneered a more interesting kind of content focus for the publication and should be considered a founding editor more-so
              than others who have stolen more credit than due in the publication’s later years.</p>
            <p name="1a3e" id="1a3e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But anyway, I’m digressing, so back on topic: Danny was visiting the publication again after leaving it in the context of a (justifiable) rage quit a few years before.</p>
            <p name="7f9b" id="7f9b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I barely knew Danny, but others knew him and the visit was a big deal.</p>
            <p name="109a" id="109a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I said “Hello.” And he was fairly cold, “Oh, I know you…” he said in an aggressively passive aggressive way. There was a constant simmering hostility between old staff and new
              and there’s not much that could be done other than grin and bear it and just let it pass.</p>
            <p name="5fa7" id="5fa7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He walked passed me, down the office’s small hallway and headed into the writer’s room where he was all smiles, laughs and warmly greeting old co-workers.</p>
            <p name="78a6" id="78a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I went back to work doing whatever I was doing. And at the time I was either putting together pizza and beer ads or working on something on the publication’s website.</p>
            <p name="347d" id="347d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">It was a bright and sunny afternoon and — as dumpy as the office I was in was like — there was at least a nice view down Main Street of the sunset over the town.

          <div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn">
            <p name="d3c0" id="d3c0" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">A few hours later I was winding down and ready to go home. I was bullshitting with some co-workers in the design department when suddenly Todd ran into the office.</p>
            <p name="07ba" id="07ba" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Jack! You have to help!” I looked at him, looked at my co-workers, they turned around and got back to getting ready to go home and I stood up and
              followed Todd back to his desk.</p>
            <p name="718d" id="718d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By this time in the history of the publication, the egos were getting quite ripe. Newfound fame — thanks to their raised Internet presence — had made big fish in a small pond
              even bigger fish in the same small pond. Which made things awkward at times.</p>
            <p name="c90a" id="c90a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I still wrote now and then, but stopped writing regularly for them when the ego stew started to boil over. In fact Todd and I had many idiotic passive aggressive
              conflicts based on not much more than petit issues such as him being a delusional mental case and asshole and also me continually refusing his utterly unwanted sexual advances. Should I also mention he was homophobic and would routinely
              harass people by shouting, “He’s gay!” And bullshit like that? Well I just did so there!</p>

          <div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn">
            <p name="f317" id="f317" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Anyway, Todd dragged me back to his office and started rambling incoherently about losing a Word document on his hard drive and how he spent days writing and was one deadline and
              now he had nothing and maybe it was a sudden Word crash or something else and could I help him and he knew that if a file was deleted the data might still be on the hard disk and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah…</p>
            <p name="f65d" id="f65d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I nodded and nodded and waited for a pause in his rambling and then said, “Let me sit down and look.”</p>
            <p name="c445" id="c445" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I sat down to look and see what I could see. It was one of those old dumpy all-in-one PowerMac G3 machines; not an iMac but just an awkward grey bloated whale of a computer with
              a concave CRT monitor that was made for some odd reason at the time.</p>
            <p name="c02b" id="c02b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While I was poking around the system, Todd was kneeling next to me rambling on and on. I wanted to ask him to give me some space, but when Todd acted like this there was little
              that could be done to stop him.</p>
            <p name="d417" id="d417" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Danny came into the writer’s office looking for Todd. “So we’re going to Nick’s. You coming?” And then Todd responded aggressively, “Jack needs to recover my file and then I can
              go.” Then he turned to look at me and blurted, “Do it Jack!”</p>
            <p name="c02d" id="c02d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I dead-stared at him, looked at the computer and unplugged it.</p>
            <p name="24e8" id="24e8" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Why did you do that!?!” he screamed at me as if I was deliberately sabotaging things and I responded, “Your best bet at data recovery now is simply
              unplugging the machine, booting up with a data recovery tool and hope fragments of the file are still around.”</p>
            <p name="df8d" id="df8d" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“But why did you do that?!?!” He started to blurt at me; shaking all the while.</p>
            <p name="3dff" id="3dff" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Let me do this Todd,” I said as I walked past him, past Danny and back to the pile of software in the production office, found a data recovery CD-Rom
              and headed back into the writer’s office.</p>
            <p name="db47" id="db47" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">As I sat down, Danny and Todd were glowering at me as if I wasn’t working fast enough. Neither one even saying one positive thing about these efforts or showing
              enough basic humility to walk away. But at least they were quiet and not getting in the way of things.</p>

            <p name="e0c3" id="e0c3" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">After a few minutes of scanning the disk a few files popped up. One of them was the trashed file. It was not fully recoverable, but since it was a text file something of some
              sort could be pulled off the disk.</p>
            <p name="ec49" id="ec49" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I found a floppy disk on Todd’s desk, stuck it in and saved what could.</p>
            <p name="f14b" id="f14b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Todd ran over to me all crazy eyed, grabbed the hand I was holding the disk in and said, “Give it to me!”</p>
            <p name="c492" id="c492" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I physically pushed him back and said “Wait, Todd. I still need to do something.” And walked past him to get back to my office.</p>
            <p name="d7ee" id="d7ee" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“What do you have to do Jack! What do you have to do Jack!” he screamed, standing in the hallway with Danny and some other writers and staff looking
              on.</p>
            <p name="6937" id="6937" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“What’s happening?” one of my co-workers asked.</p>
            <p name="e1b9" id="e1b9" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Well, I managed to recover something from Todd’s mess but it’s not 100% good. Need to do some manual work,” I said.</p>
            <p name="cd35" id="cd35" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He nodded, let me pass him and I sat down at my desk and worked on the file.</p>
            <p name="ba13" id="ba13" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All I really had to do was open it up in a text editor save it in a text file and, et voilà… Recovered data!</p>
            <p name="089f" id="089f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I mean, at least this damaged Word file was basically just a pile of text so it was easy enough to separate 70% of the text that was readable from the damaged data crazy
              character crap.</p>
            <p name="c271" id="c271" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">With that recovered data on a floppy disk I walked outside into the hallway, smiled and waved the floppy disk at Todd and said, “Not 100% but it’s something!”</p>

            <p name="7e33" id="7e33" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">I walked past him, straight into the writer’s office, popped the floppy into disk into the Todd’s computer, copied the file to his desktop, opened it up in Word and called him
              over.</p>
            <p name="5e07" id="5e07" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As Todd sat down, I headed out into the hallway to talk to others and things seemed calm and good.</p>
            <p name="4ac1" id="4ac1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After a while Todd screamed in joy, “You did! Jack did it!” and ran out into the hallway.</p>
            <p name="626b" id="626b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This was a great moment while it lasted.</p>
            <p name="5234" id="5234" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For a few measly seconds, I basked in the glow of the concept that Todd could be respectful and nice to someone for once. And after a few measly seconds past, a happy thing
              turned to garbage as Todd ran to me, broke past that small personal space area we all have, grabbed me aggressively at the waist with one hand, grabbed the back of my head with his other hand and tried to kiss me full open mouthed.</p>
            <p name="2057" id="2057" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I pushed and pushed and shouted, “Todd! Todd! Todd!” It seemed to go on forever but it had to be about 7 seconds in hell. As I struggled some people laughed while others shouted,
              “Todd, stop! Todd, stop!”</p>
            <p name="92c3" id="92c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Nobody attempted to pull Todd off of me as we both slammed into the reception counter in the hallway, but after a while I managed to shove Todd away from me.</p>
            <p name="9986" id="9986" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As he took a few steps back away from me, he was giddily smiling, giggling and saying, “Thanks Jack! Thanks Jack!” repeatedly. Danny looked at me stone-faced and said nothing as
              he held the door open for Todd.</p>
            <p name="b854" id="b854" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Soon Todd was through the doorway, Danny let go of the door and followed him and soon enough they were gone. Utterly nobody said anything or even asked “Are you okay.”</p>
            <p name="3278" id="3278" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After a beat or two, everyone went back to where their offices or headed out to the hallway as well to head home.</p>
            <p name="eb7a" id="eb7a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I headed back to the my office, stood silently looking at the orange glow of the sunset for a few seconds, then grabbed my stuff, headed out of the office and waited for the
              elevator. After a while I decided it was better to head to one of the rear stairwells that let out to a side-street near the back of the building and didn’t let out into the main lobby where I might run into Todd.</p>
            <p name="361e" id="361e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I ran down those stairs, headed out into the street and headed back home. All I remember of the walk back home was me leaving the building and then suddenly me
              being back in my apartment… Laying down and staring at the ceiling.</p>
