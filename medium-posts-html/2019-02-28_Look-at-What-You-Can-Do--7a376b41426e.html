              <figcaption class="imageCaption">A pic of stuff on my desk at the wacky weekly local newspaper. (Photo by Jack Szwergold; Taken December 1998)</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p name="1df6" id="1df6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">It was sometime in the late 1990s. Maybe 1997 or 1998. I was still living in the midwest and still working for the wacky weekly local newspaper; which was a thing back in
              the late 1990s.</p>
            <p name="271b" id="271b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think it was fall or winter, but I remember it was dark and I was working late on a Friday at the publication’s office on ass end of State Street; right near the capitol and
              across the street from the porn shop. It was only Rob and I in the office with Rob next door in his tiny — yet powerful — “I’m the editor!” office and me in the larger production office that would usually be crammed with 3 people during
              most days.</p>
            <p name="64f3" id="64f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Three of the old school writers — Todd, Nadia and John — were done wrapping up their writing and miscellaneous bullshit and such and were getting ready to head out to Nick’s bar
              down the street to get a few beers and some food.</p>
            <p name="30ff" id="30ff" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing">“You sure you don’t want to go?” one of them asked me and then asked Rob. I politely declined and they headed out.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section name="3c30" class="section section--body section--last">
        <div class="section-divider">
          <hr class="section-divider">
        </div>
        <div class="section-content">
          <div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn">
            <p name="e0f0" id="e0f0" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">After an hour or so the three of them came back from Nick’s and everyone was clearly drunk but not completely incoherent. More like they were pleasantly buzzed. But I barely
              remember them being actually being that pleasant when buzzed, lit or simply fucked up on anything.</p>
            <p name="ff27" id="ff27" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The three of them stumbled into the office, headed over to where the offices Rob and I were in and drunkly said “Hello!” to us.</p>
            <p name="064a" id="064a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I stopped what I was doing, politely smiled and waved at them, put my headphones back on and then quickly got back to work. They then shifted their drunken welcome wagon over to
              Rob’s office, greeted him as they did me but then started to give him drunken grief about him not going out to drink with them.</p>
            <p name="d330" id="d330" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Within seconds of them saying Rob should drink more, Todd — the alpha misanthrope of the trio — blurted out, “I mean Jews don’t drink, right?” He did it in the same jokey — yet
              menacing — way all of the stupid passive-aggressive nonsense came out of him. I looked at him, let the wind of that bigoted bullshit pass over me and then was ready to go back to work when his eyes shifted to me and he blurted out the
              same thing again, “I mean Jews don’t drink, right Jack?”</p>
            <p name="d2ea" id="d2ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I smirked, took a deep breath, put my headphones back on and turned back to my work. This all happened in less than a few seconds but it all seemed like slow motion. Todd always
              had a menacing side, and we all dealt with it our own ways, but when his menacing became a literal attack the feeling was always new and befuddling.</p>
            <p name="2bb1" id="2bb1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Todd laughed a bit under his panting breath, then pulled away from hovering outside my office, straightened up his back and took a few steps back to his drunken group.</p>
            <p name="5fcd" id="5fcd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He then looked at John and Nadia, and — after a silent beat or two — Todd pulled Nadia towards him, grabs her head and pushes it into his face and aggressively kisses her; full
              open mouthed. She’s clearly not into it and nervously laughing and crying as his leather driving gloved hand pushes her head into his. While they were friends for years, they were never a couple and this was never expected or wanted.
              Nadia just went along with it and we all looked at them stunned; as if we just witnessed a car crash.</p>
            <p name="f5a4" id="f5a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then he pulled back — while still holding her — and shoved his hand down the front of her pants and shouted, “Look Rob! Look at what you can do to Nadia when she’s drunk!” He
              then went back to shoving his face back into hers; one hand still gripping behind her head and the other straight down her pants clearly feeling her up.</p>
            <p name="caf4" id="caf4" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Todd!” Rob blurted out from his office, as I pulled off my headphones, stood up and walked to the doorway. John — who was closer to them than Rob
              and — made some timid efforts to break things up by repeatedly saying, “Todd… Todd… Todd…” but didn’t do anything to really stop the attack.</p>
            <p name="3c2b" id="3c2b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rob shouted again, “Todd!” and then he completely disengaged and physically pulled back. Nadia stood there drunkenly laughing but not much else. Nobody really did or said
              anything more. The laughing stopped and then everyone broke off from the group. Todd said nothing and headed outside to smoke in the stairwell as he usually did. Nadia stood around slowly coming back to normal and John did not do much
              of anything.</p>
            <p name="114b" id="114b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Things calmed down but the crazy incident was just as quickly forgotten as it happened. Nobody was really verbal in the post-attack moments. And nobody talked about it again.</p>
            <p name="9871" id="9871" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">John and Nadia left and Rob and I went back to work. I finished my work up and left.</p>
            <p name="a03d" id="a03d" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing">“Goodnight Rob,” I said as I walked to the exit. He waved and went back to his work. I headed to the elevator, headed outside and
              headed back home.</p>
