            <p name="acde" id="acde" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Junior was John Junior the building’s superintendent’s son who lived right downstairs from us. He was generally okay and wasn’t a bully in any way. But give him a chance to do
              something dicky and he would do it.</p>
            <p name="7f1b" id="7f1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think it was after he went to college — or maybe even after graduating high school — he got drafted by some European basketball team. Basketball in the United States was big,
              but not as big as it is nowadays and young players got picked up as ringers for overseas teams. Anyway there was a buzz about his sudden professional jump in the neighborhood. He would play on the courts at 2nd Street Park all the time.
            </p>
            <p name="47c3" id="47c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I liked playing basketball in summer camp and was really good at layups. It was a skill that earned me some respect among the kids from Trump Village and got me picked somewhere
              near the middle when pickup teams were chosen instead of near end when only rejects were picked. My layup skills made me less of an oddball.</p>
            <p name="70e8" id="70e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Despite this joy, my childhood passion in the sport was rewarded with some crappy toy basketball for my birthday from my brother who only liked soccer, vocally considered all
              other sports to be “stupid” and would never shut up about it. My father wasn’t really into sports and the family didn’t have a lot of money, so my dad relied on my brother — who is 20 years older than me — to advise on things I would
              enjoy. So my brother’s decision to get me a toy basketball was something I couln’t easilly remedy; heck he never even passed along receipts so things could be returned but that’s a different story.</p>
            <p name="76d0" id="76d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is a slight tangent, but to better understand where this crappy basketball came from, I complained about the real — and utterly useless — soccer ball my brother got me a few
              months before for Hannukah. 100% of nobody played soccer in the neighborhood back in the 1970s but pretty much everybody played basketball. The real soccer ball collected dust in the closet while the toy basketball got real playtime on
              real courts.</p>
            <p name="7247" id="7247" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While I hated the toy basketball, I dealt with it. At least it was kind of the right size and I could sort of dribble it if I inflated it enough. So I made the best of this
              crappy, passive-aggresive “gift” from my brother since I just wanted to play basketball in some way. And 2nd Street Park was where I’d attempt to play since there was a decent mix of kids there.</p>
            <p name="85f6" id="85f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I could never practice playing with a toy basketball like that around the tougher, older, more experienced kids at other courts around the neighorhood like the courts in Trump
              Village. But I could at least find one measely empty court at 2nd Street Park — where the kids were easier to deal with — to practice dribbling, layups and shots with the piece of junk. And if I couldn’t? I could just hang out and do
              something else.</p>
            <p name="b488" id="b488" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So one day I was walking to 2nd Street Park down Brighton 1st Road — where the library was — and I didn’t hear any of the familiar sounds of kids playing or much of any noise. It
              wasn’t like it was completely silent, but it was more like it was deader than usual for a nice summer day. And when I hooked a left and got near the 2nd Street Park courts I saw it. The basketball courts were empty, nobody was playing
              anything on them and all of the hoops were bent or just broken off completely. It was pretty unbelievable.</p>
            <p name="e3d2" id="e3d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I walked into the park and found some other kids hanging out and talking. I asked them what happened. They told me Junior broke all the hoops the night before. But how he could
              he do that? He was in Europe, right? I wandered around the courts for a few minutes to take in the scene. And eventually left through a hole in the fence and walked back home.</p>
            <p name="7a8a" id="7a8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As I came near my building I saw my superintendent’s family outside the building but no sign of Junior. I waved hello and went back home and told my dad about what I saw. He was
              puzzled for a second or so and then he said he heard Junior came back to visit his family for a few days from Europe but didn’t see him; he did say other people said he looked good. Then my dad went back to reading the newspaper.</p>
            <p name="e3c1" id="e3c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So Junior visits his family in Brooklyn because he’s doing well as a professional basketball player. But then he trashes the exact hoops that helped him get where he is so nobody
              can enjoy them anymore. He got what he needed from the courts and that was that.</p>
            <p name="c242" id="c242" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Being NYC in the early 1980s the NYC Department of Parks and Recreation wasn’t rushing to get the hoops fixed since they were always having budgetary problems or some nonsense
              like that. I think they were fixed four months later by the time fall rolled around. But by then it was too cold to play and I didn’t care about basketball much anymore or even wanted to deal with the other playgrounds and the horeshit
              territorial politics they contained just to practice playing.</p>
            <p name="62ad" id="62ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">So the basketball joined the soccer ball in the closet and that was the end of that.</p>
