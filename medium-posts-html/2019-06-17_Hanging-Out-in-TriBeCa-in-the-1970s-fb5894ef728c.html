            </figure>
            <p name="06ec" id="06ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">If you want to call me a cool kid, please do. You see, back in 1975 or 1976 — when I was 7 or 8 years old — I visited TriBeCa for the first time… With my mom and dad.</p>
            <p name="4320" id="4320" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not at the Mudd Club or Artist’s Space or anything like that but in a huge factory just South of Canal Street in TriBeCa.</p>
            <p name="6bcf" id="6bcf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The space was a garment factory and — one Saturday morning — my mom, dad and I headed out from the ass end of Brooklyn to TriBeCa so my mom could look for work.</p>
            <p name="f54b" id="f54b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We all took the train out of Brighton Beach. I was grey and overcast and — since it was a weekend morning — the subway was pretty dead and desolate. The train car itself was one
              of those rickety old metal cars that was kinda corrugated on the side; most likely still had the old “TA” (Transit Authority) logo on the side. And — like every subway trip for me — the trip was fun. I really liked looking out the
              windows of subway as it trudged through Brooklyn. Especially the window at the front of the first car; looking out and holding onto the door handle of the first car felt like I was actually driving the train as it sped along.</p>
            <p name="545a" id="545a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As the train rolled along, I’d get excited when I saw glimmers of what looked like toys, balls and related cool junk on the tracks. I even had daydreams of rushing off at a
              nearby stop and running onto the subway tracks and to score some free cool stuff.</p>
            <p name="f390" id="f390" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But all of that was not to be. First, I was too young and would most likely get hit by a train and die — or at least loose a limb — if I did something like that. Second, we — as
              a family — needed to head into Manhattan to see if my mom could get a job in some kind of schmatta factory somewhere.</p>
            <p name="f569" id="f569" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You see, my dad was essentially laid off from his job at the Williamsburg box factory in 1975 due to disability. He had a heart attack and — on doctor’s orders — could not do any
              heavy manual work anymore. And he wasn’t in the Union long enough to get disability; 4–5 years shy by my estimation. So with no real job prospects for my dad, my mom stepped up to the plate to be the new breadwinner of the family. And
              since — like my dad — she didn’t even have a high school education, the best she could do was manual labor of some sort in the lower rungs of the garment industry.</p>
            <p name="ebb1" id="ebb1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As we got off subway, we all stuck together and absorbed everything around us around like hawks because this was the classic gritty NYC of the 1970s. Abe Beame’s shithole of a
              city which was the city I grew up in and it was a genuinely dangerous place at the time.</p>
            <p name="b453" id="b453" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While my parents looked around and tried to spot threats — real and imagined — before they happened, I soaked in what I could trying to find any shred of fun I could find in this
              dump of a city. Like Dave’s Luncheonette on the corner of Canal Street and Broadway.</p>
            <p name="966b" id="966b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To me, the place looked so fancy and cool with it’s neon signs and shiny diner exterior highlights. But we never stopped in the place at all; not even to use the bathroom. In our
              case, we just stepped out of the subway, swung onto Broadway and walked a few blocks down, then through a rickety door and up a dingy staircase to a darkened — but dimly lit — factory floor. Light streamed in from whatever windows were
              still there but nobody was working.</p>
            <p name="f915" id="f915" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I remember seeing rows upon rows of sewing machines all lined up in various rows; too many to count. Lots of industrial green and bare wood all around. And it was relatively
              quiet; not even the sound of a radio could be heard in the empty, cavernous space. And past any of that, nobody seemed to be in the factory yet we walked in as if it were no issue; New York was unsafe back then but the front door was
              just open like that? Weird.</p>
            <p name="4bad" id="4bad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After a brief pause to look around, my dad shouted a “Hello!” that echoed throughout the floor. We heard some faint shuffling from the far end of the floor and a person appeared
              out of a side room at the very back of the factory floor and responded “What?”</p>
            <p name="5b70" id="5b70" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My mom and dad looked at each other, looked at me and told me to stay “Right here…” meaning up front. I nodded a humble child-like “Yes…” and with that they walked to the back of
              the factory where that guy was.</p>
            <p name="1c75" id="1c75" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I stood around, but also meandered around up front; not wandering too far out of sight of my parents, but not really standing still either. I peered around and peeked around to
              see what I could see. I was a kid so I was also looking for some cool stuff to shove in my pocket. But all I saw were miscellaneous things like screws, nails, sewing machine related items and old-school tin cans of oil. Nothing worth
              much of anything to me or any other kid.</p>
            <p name="e2fa" id="e2fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I heard some mumbling and looked back down the aisle to my parents talking to the factory guy. I could hear them speak to him in Yiddish, Hebrew or whatever and saw my dad and
              the guy leaning into each other with lots of hand gesticulation and “expression” going on. Hand motions, waving and other such stuff that immigrants tended to do when they communicated passionately about something. And passionate it
              was; not angry or hateful. Clearly some kind of ethnic negotiation was going on.</p>
            <p name="2d6a" id="2d6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After a while there was a pause and my mom and dad came up front with the factory guy following close behind. When they came up front my dad leaned over and said to me, “Okay.
              It’s time to go home.” The factory guy looked at me, looked at my parents and just miscellaneously shrugged. It wasn’t a judgmental shrug, but my parents had me in their 40s and at the time of this encounter they were in their early
              50s. I looked more like I should be their grandson at the time; not their son. But there I was and their son I was.</p>
            <p name="4fab" id="4fab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While it was never explicitly said, I’m pretty sure my parents dragged me along to score some sympathy points with the factory guy. I mean, showing off a kid as a desperate
              dependent for a job is a way of pushing sympathy buttons, right?</p>
            <p name="62d7" id="62d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Anyway, we walked back down the stairs of the factory, walked up Broadway — past Dave’s Luncheonette — and turned onto Canal Street. We briefly paused to look
              around and see if there was any bargain hunting to be done — something my parents always did after one of these work/family trips — and since there wasn’t much of anything we could spy past basic junk stores, we headed back into the
              subway and headed back home to the ass end of Brooklyn.</p>
