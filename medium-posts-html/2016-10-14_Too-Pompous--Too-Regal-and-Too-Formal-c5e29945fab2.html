            <p name="bd8e" id="bd8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I was in 9th grade in junior high school when <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Return of the Jedi</em> rolled into everyone’s world and nobody was surprised by anything
              related the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em> franchise anymore. Some rich kid classmate had already shared his copy of the Marvel comics adaptation of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Return of the Jedi</em> with
              everyone a few weeks before. He scored it from his media connected brother — who worked in “the city” — before it officially hit the newsstands. So we all knew a pretty good chunk of the plot already.</p>
            <p name="405b" id="405b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But past that, the true nail in the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em> “awe and wonder” coffin was hammered in place one day when our middle-aged social studies
              teacher decided to spend the last 15 minutes of class yammering about seeing it in “the city” the night before.</p>
            <p name="2639" id="2639" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I saw it opening night in the city and it was <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">spectacular</em>!” he said with no irony to a class of 14 and 15
              year olds with a light dusting of blackboard chalk on the navy blue J.C. Penney “Fox Collection” (Izod Lacoste knock-off) polo shirt he was wearing. “The special effects were <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">unbelievable</em>!” he
              said with all of the sad authority of a pompous full grown adult who somehow needing to try to “connect” a classroom filled with bored, disinterested adolescents.</p>
            <p name="bb67" id="bb67" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After declaring his love of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Return of the Jedi</em>, he then “opened up the floor” so we could all awkwardly ask a middle-aged social studies
              teacher — that nobody really liked — vaguely disinterested questions about the film itself. He half-heartedly answered a few questions with a few half-assed answers and within a few minutes, the class dismissed.</p>
            <p name="4c0d" id="4c0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Everyone piled out of the classroom, ran down the staircase, headed out of the school and onto Neptune Avenue; the street right in front of the school. “So do you want to go and
              see it?” I heard one of my classmates say. “Sure,” I responded, “But where and when?” Neither us knew so we started flipping through somebody’s copy of the Daily News on a nearby bench to check theaters and times.</p>
            <p name="e37d" id="e37d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Unlike past releases of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em> and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Empire Strikes Back</em> — which were initially limited
              releases that grew in size as weeks went on — <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Return of the Jedi</em> was opening at pretty much every theater worth going to in the city and even a few in Brooklyn as well such as the Kingsway on
              King’s Highway and Coney Island Avenue.</p>
            <p name="d84a" id="d84a" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“That’s it. They’re showing it at the Kingsway. How about Saturday?” We all agreed and decided to meet on Saturday in front of the Kingsway about 1/2
              hour before showtime.</p>
            <p name="9393" id="9393" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Unlike modern blockbuster movies in the post-<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em> era — where people wait in line and camp out for days on end — you could still
              show up at a theater without much deep planning on an opening weekend in the 1980s and have no problems getting in. So that’s what we did.</p>
            <p name="3260" id="3260" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Despite the fact the Kingsway was already broken up into smaller theaters to be a multiplex, the specific theater we were going to see <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Return
                of the Jedi</em> in was huge since it used to be the balcony of the original Kingsway. It was nowhere near as huge the Loews Astor Plaza in Times Square — where I first saw <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em> — but it
              was still noticeably larger than most standalone theaters in Brooklyn. We bought our tickets, ran up the stairs and found some seats near the left, center side of the theater.</p>
            <p name="0a2f" id="0a2f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From the get go, the experience didn’t take us away to a galaxy far, far away. First, the theater was packed and nobody would shut up; especially parents who brought their
              children along to see <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Return of the Jedi</em> who were way clearly too young to give a damn about the film. Next, was the film itself. It immediately felt stilted and stiff from the moment Darth Vader
              first appears and suddenly there is some huge, awkward color guard of Imperial troops, officers and staff there to greet him. That made it feel all too pompous, too regal and too formal to be a part of the <em
                class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em> universe that preceded it. But then it only got worse as the film went on and the endless parade of oddball bullshit aliens in masks showed up.</p>
            <p name="6fb4" id="6fb4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From the guy who looked who looked like he had a thyroid problem with a tentacle in his head who said “De Wanna Wanga” to C3P0 (Bib Fortuna), to the talking teddy bears with
              spears (Ewoks), to the lobster headed guy shouting “It’s a trap!” (Admiral Ackbar) the amount of bullshit aliens in the film was just a bit much. “Who/what the fuck is that guy/thing?” was a question every one of us seemed to ask with
              every other scene.</p>
            <p name="2875" id="2875" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And if the seemingly endless parade of bullshit aliens wasn’t bad enough, the acting of the core <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em> cast itself was pretty stilted
              and stiff as well. Harrison Ford was hamming it up in pretty much every shot while Mark Hamill was trying his hardest to be dark, brooding and intense but mainly came off as flat, strained and lackluster.</p>
            <p name="8019" id="8019" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All of this is not to say that <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Return of the Jedi</em> didn’t have it’s fun moments — such as the the speeder bike chase in the forest or the
              final Death Star battle — but those were all simply well-choreographed action scenes. The overall film itself felt soulless, tedious and meaningless. When all was said and done, seeing Darth Vader defeated and unmasked felt more like a
              hokey gimmick at the end of a crappy video game “boss level” rather than some awe inspiring, heroic plot point you have waited years to see.</p>
            <p name="a954" id="a954" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As the final credits rolled — and the lights in the theater came on — one of my friends said it best, “I don’t know what the fuck that was.” Nobody disagreed.</p>
            <p name="9dd6" id="9dd6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">We all left the theater and went our separate ways. It was a bright and sunny spring day. They all headed back to Brighton Beach while I crossed Coney Island
              Avenue to check out new records at Crazy Eddie before heading home myself and calling it a day.</p>
