# Too Pompous, Too Regal and Too Formal (The First Time I Saw Return of the Jedi)

By Jack Szwergold, June 15, 2015

I was in 9th grade in junior high school when *Return of the Jedi* rolled into everyone’s world and nobody was surprised by anything related the *Star Wars* franchise anymore. Some rich kid classmate had already shared his copy of the Marvel comics adaptation of *Return of the Jedi* with everyone a few weeks before. He scored it from his media connected brother—who worked in “the city”—before it officially hit the newsstands. So we all knew a pretty good chunk of the plot already.

But past that, the true nail in the *Star Wars* “awe and wonder” coffin was hammered in place one day when our middle-aged social studies teacher decided to spend the last 15 minutes of class yammering about seeing it in “the city” the night before.

“I saw it opening night in the city and it was *spectacular*!” he said with no irony to a class of 14 and 15 year olds with a light dusting of blackboard chalk on the navy blue J.C. Penney “Fox Collection” (Izod Lacoste knock-off) polo shirt he was wearing. “The special effects were *unbelievable*!” he said with all of the sad authority of a pompous full grown adult who somehow needing to try to “connect” a classroom filled with bored, disinterested adolescents.

After declaring that, he then “opened up the floor” so we could all awkwardly ask a middle-aged social studies teacher—that nobody really liked—vaguely disinterested questions about key points in the film. He half-heartedly answered a few questions with a few half-assed answers and within a few minutes, the class dismissed.





We all piled out classroom, ran down the staircase, headed out of the school and onto the sunny spring street. “So do you want to go and see it?” I heard one of my classmates say. “Sure,” I responded, “But where and when?” Neither us knew so we started flipping through somebody’s copy of the Daily News to check times and theaters.

Unlike past releases of *Star Wars* and *The Empire Strikes Back*—which were initially limited releases that grew in size as weeks went on—*Return of the Jedi* was opening at pretty much every theater worth going to in the city. Even a few in Brooklyn as well such as the Kingsway on King’s Highway and Coney Island Avenue.

“That’s it. They’re showing it at the Kingsway. How about Saturday?” We all agreed and decided to meet on Saturday in front of the Kingsway.

Unlike modern blockbuster movies in the post-*Star Wars* era—where people wait in line and camp out for days on end—you could still show up at a theater without much deep planning on an opening weekend back then and have no problems getting in. So that’s what we did.

Despite the fact the Kingsway was broken up into smaller theaters to be a multiplex, the specific theater we were going to see *Return of the Jedi* in was was huge. Nowhere near as huge the Loews Astor Plaza in Times Square, but still bigger than most standalone theaters in Brooklyn. The newly split theater we were seeing *Return of the Jedi* in used to be the balcony of the original Kingsway and we sat down near the left, center side.

From the get go, the experience was non-thrilling. First, the theater was packed and nobody would shut up; especially parents who brought children to see the film who were too young to give a damn about the film. Next, was the film itself. It immediately felt “off” from the moment Darth Vader first appears at the beginning and suddenly there is some huge, awkward color guard of Imperial troops, officers and staff there to greet him. That made it feel all too pompous, too regal and too formal to be a part of the *Star Wars* universe that preceded it. But then it only got worse as the film went on and the endless parade of oddball aliens in bullshit masks showed up.

From the guy who looked who looked like he had a thyroid problem with a tentacle in his head (Bib Fortuna) to the talking teddy bears with spears (Ewoks) to the lobster headed guy (Admiral Ackbar) shouting “It’s a trap!” the amount of bullshit aliens in the film was just a bit much. “Who/what the fuck is that guy/thing?” was a question every one of us seemed to ask with every other scene.

And if the seemingly endless parade of aliens in bullshit masks wasn’t bad enough, the acting of the core *Star Wars* cast itself was pretty abysmal and stiff as well. Harrison Ford was hamming it up in pretty much every shot while Mark Hammill was trying his hardest to be dark, brooding and intense but mainly came off as tepid, strained and to trying to hard.

All of this is not to say that *Return of the Jedi* didn’t have it’s fun moments—such as the the speeder bike chase in the forest or the final Death Star battle—but those were all simply well-choreographed action scenes. The overall film itself felt soulless, tedious and meaningless. When all was said and done, seeing Darth Vader unmasked felt more like a hokey gimmick at the end of a crappy video game “boss level” rather than some awe inspiring, heroic plot point you have waited years to see.

As the final credits rolled—and the lights in the theater came on—one of my friends said it best, “I don’t know what the fuck that was.” Nobody disagreed.

We all left the theater and went our separate ways. It was a bright and sunny spring day. They all headed back to Brighton Beach while I crossed Coney Island Avenue to check out new records at Crazy Eddie before heading home myself and calling it a day.
