# Why Do You Listen to That Junk? (Introduction to the B-52s)

By Jack Szwergold, May 21, 2015

The first time I heard about the *B-52s* was when I called up one of the neighborhood tough guys who was a friendly to me. By “friendly” I mean he was at least not a bully to me and gave me the time of day.

The reason I was calling him was one of the gigs he had was working for a ticket scalper; waiting in line with a wristband and stuff like that. And I wanted to score some *Rush* tickets during the “Grace Under Pressure” tour. The concert was sold out through all of the legit channels, so I thought he could hook me up.

The second I asked about the tickets, he blew me off immediately and said I should call the scalper directly to deal with it. It was kind of intimidating to have to talk to a scalper directly, but at least I was one step closer to *Rush* tickets.

After he gave me the scalper’s number he said, “Why do you listen to that *Rush* junk anyway? You should listen to stuff like the *B-52s*… Chekc this out: They’re using a toy piano…” And through the phone I could barely make out the tune, but would soon learn it was the track “Dance This Mess Around” off of their first album.

I hung up the phone, made a mental note to pick up a *B-52s* album the next time I went record shopping and then called up the scalper to see what he could do for me as far as *Rush* tickets went.
