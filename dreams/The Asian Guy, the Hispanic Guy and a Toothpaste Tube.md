## The Asian Guy, the Hispanic Guy and a Toothpaste Tube

By Jack Szwergold

#### Notes on a dream I had on June 15, 2015

The dream is weird and varied. 100% no stress. Happened during an afternoon nap.

I don’t rememeber much of it but near the end—before I woke up—there are two guys sitting on what looks like a couch in a crammed area. One is Asian, the other is Hispanic. They keep on passing this toothpaste tube between them.

It’s one of those metal tubes that you get with a prescription and I keep on trying to grab it to see what it is but they both smack my hands each time I attempt to grab it. They both are a bit slow though, like they are in an opiate haze.

At some point I end up grabbing it and read the printed label. It seems like it’s some weird opiate-based pain killer ointment. I don’t want to try it but I gently scold the guys saying, “Hey! You’re addicted to this stuff!” The Asian guy—who is farther away from me than the other guy—reaches out and strongly grabs my arm like he was some kind of a machine and won’t let go until I give him back the tube.

I drop the tube between them on the couch and he lets go of my arm while they both struggle to find the tube. I take a step back and then wake up.
