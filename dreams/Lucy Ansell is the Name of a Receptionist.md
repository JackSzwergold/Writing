## Lucy Ansell is the Name of a Receptionist

By Jack Szwergold, April 13, 2015

#### Notes on a dream I had on April 13, 2015

Lucy Ansell is the name of the receptionist at some cool industrial office. I made out out with her in that cool industrial office after dealing with anti-Semitic restaurant owner dressed in Nazi SS garb. I only realized the silhouette of a logo of an eagle with a flag on the restaurant awning was Nazi inspired after seeing the guy in Nazi garb and then realized how obvious it was.

Mailboxes changed in the building. One lone box was installed. We’re all happy they are changing the mailboxes, but why only one and what about the rest of them?

Forgot to pay for a book on Han Solo and Chewbacca’s therapy sessions. It’s a dual language book. One half was Russian, the other English.
