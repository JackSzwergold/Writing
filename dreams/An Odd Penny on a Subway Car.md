## An Odd Penny on a Subway Car

#### Notes on a dream I had on June 6, 2016

I don’t remember the complete flow—or overall narrative—of this dream but it contained imagery surrounding coins.

At one point in this specific dream I am sitting on a subway train and see what looks like a penny on the floor. I lift myself out of the seat, lean over and pick it up. But as I look closer at the coin, I notice that it’s not really a penny but rather a modified penny.

The face of Abraham Lincoln has been carved and modified to look like a woman. A somewhat 1960s looking woman with a long neck and somewhat conservative hairdo. She looks like she should be wearing glasses but isn’t wearing any.

The edges of the penny have been clipped as well; instead of being a perfect circle, five flat edges are clipped off to form an off-kilter pentagon. The edges are straight but smooth as if they were once rough and sharp from being cut but now have been smoothed out over time from regular handling.

The back of the penny has been modified as well; the Lincoln Memorial is no longer there and what remains in the center is an awkwardly shaped square of some kind. The pillars of the parts of the Lincoln Memorial that remain have been carved out a bit to be somewhat deeper. They look like thick prison window bars now.

Surrounding that awkward square on the back is a small cluster of clipped out words securely glued to the surface; somewhat like decoupage but suprisingly stronger but it still shows the slight patina of wear from handling over time.
