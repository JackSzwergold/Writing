## Michael Jackson Buys the 2nd Floor of My Building

By Jack Szwergold

#### Notes on a dream I had on May 26, 2015

Apparently the 2nd floor of the 3 story building I live in was purchased my Michael Jackson as a “pied-à-terre” or something like that. Never mind he’s dead; nobody was acknowledging that well known fact. The news was that Michael Jackson owns the place and that’s that.

There’s a huge line of people going up the staircase to the building. It’s a tall industrial staircase that goes straight up with only minimal landings between floors. The stairs are painted blue and there are tons of people pushing their way down. The entrance to the space  is on the 2nd landing.

I squeeze in through the entrance and it is less crowded. There are tons of art on the walls. The place looks like it was cleaned up and made into an art gallery. Some of the art is hanging on the wall and some of the art is painted in the wall as a mural. The walls to the rooms to the front and back are primarily white and the center hallway-ish area is painted black with white lines used to draw the art.

I’m attempting to take pictures but there are issues with focusing that might be coming from the type of overhead lighting used. I move to the front room and there is a black woman with greyish, curly hair in a short haircut behind a table willing to explain her wares to me. Some people are sitting at another table nearby singing or humming Bob Dylan’s “Positively 4th Street” for some reason. The place is abuzz with people talking about what it will mean for Michael Jackson to move into the neighborhood. Nobody is acknowledging that Michael Jackson dead.
