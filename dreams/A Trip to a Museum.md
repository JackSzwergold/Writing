## A Trip to a Museum

By Jack Szwergold

#### Notes on a dream I had on May 23, 2018

I was in some kind of modern art museum. Somewhat DIY, like the New Museum.

There are all these tables set up like little miniature islands and landscapes. Each is different, but similar. Some have objects like little cabinets of curiosity and such. They are mostly vertical 9 square grid (3x3).

I am trying to take a picture of one of them but one of these dark modern art hippies gets in the way. Just as I am staring to get frustrated, one of the hippie dorks pushes the thing off of the table with his index finger.

The object falls on the ground, and pieces  break off but the core grid is still in place.

I walk around, and soon I find a new area where it’s a slightly bigger. It’s all on the ground. I notice a little pond like area with small animals like squirrels and colorful parrots walking around eating.

I carefully look into the other room to make sure those stupid street art hippies follow me in.

I sit down and pet one of the parrots on its head. It squeaks a little and seems to enjoy it.

A woman with brown curly hair sits down near me. We know each other yet don’t know each other. One of the birds squeaks and snaps at her hand when she reaches out to pet it. She flinches a bit and I put my hand on her leg to reassure her things are good. She reaches over and pulls it off while whispering, “We’re not going there…” to which I respond, “I’m not going no there.” And she lets go and my hand falls back on her leg.

She reaches into her bag and pulls out a pair of scissors and clips off the tops of three of the parrots tail feathers. I am shocked but the parrot doesn’t seem to mind.

“It’s already stuck on the ground so it doesn’t care,” she says as she puts the scissors back in her bag and leans over onto me.
