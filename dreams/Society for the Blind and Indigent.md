#### Notes on a dream I had on May 24, 2015

I met a downstairs neighbor outside the building we live in. Suddenly we are in the middle of a place that looks like Sunset Park and outside a huge place that looks like a mega discount store. We walk in and I see some workers packing disposable napkins into plastic wrappers at a wooden table. He stops a second to say hello and shout something at them in Spanish. Then we keep on walking through the crammed aisle until he told me to hook a right, then we looped back and made a left under some entrance way that looked like a hole was punched in the neighboring storefront.

There were tons of Sega Master Systems and Sega Genesis systems and controllers hanging from pegs in the ceiling. Many looked like used systems, but some were new in box. But the boxes were a little shelf worn. We kept on walking and there were aisle of oddball electronics. Like the kind of stuff you would see in a discount store. We kept on walking and there was this weird shrine in a wall. Dark, but lit by candles. Candles in jars. Not like those candles for saints, but more like fat mason jars, but crappier looking. Every now and then this white candle in a jar in the middle would push forward and everyone would be shocked. I wasn’t too freaked out and neither was my neighbor. I pointed out it had to be magnets and my neighbor agreed, but there was no way to prove it.

I scanned the floor for a paperclip or washer or something metalic like that; something I could hook up to a string to prove the issue. But I found nothing of the sort.

As I was stooped over, I saw a cute gray and white kitten pop out near the wall. The kitten was pensive and looking at me. Some woman to my left knelt down to look at the kitten with me. I turned to her to say, “Look!” but then when we looked the cat no longer looked like a kitten. It was the same cat, but seemed older and mangy with a missing eye and was scowling at us. Then we stood up and looked at the candle.

After a while I left my neighbor behind and walked away with the woman. Suddenly we were both on the stone steps of some huge staircase-like facade like in front of a courthouse but the steps are just high enough to be really awkward to climb down. We eventually climb down all the way and walk down the street to what looks like an odd industrial area like Sunset Park.

We realize we are going the wrong way and then turn around. We end up on a street in Sunset Park that has some weird social club/bar on it; a blue painted facade with neon signage. There is a sign in the top part of the door that rolls down as we look at it that says in embossed blue letters, “Society for the Blind and Indigent.” We both shrug and keep on walking past it since we are clearly not wanted there.
