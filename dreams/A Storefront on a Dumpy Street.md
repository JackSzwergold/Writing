## A Storefront on a Dumpy Street

By Jack Szwergold

#### Notes on a dream I had on November 18, 2015

I’m at some odd office. It’s like some gallery space or a mall or something like that. There are walls but they are all doors with glass and there are some doors. Like a slightly nice data center.

I’m sitting down at some table waiting to eat with somene I am meeting with, but I don’t see him. His big grey dog comes over and rests his head in my lap. I pet and pet and then food arrives. The dog looks up as expected, but I pet, pet, pet and pet the dog.

Then the person I am meeting with shows up. I take a few bites of food, he says nothing and I say I have to leave. I get up and start walking down a fairly nice—yet dumpy—street. There is some rack of women’s clothes in front of it and this big red-haired girl with a Jewfro out in front of the rack just acting silly. Not sexy silly—even when she is showing off her cleavage as I pass—but just silly silly. There’s nothing sexy about her to me.

As I walk by the actual storefront, it’s pretty sparse. White walls and hardwood floors. There is some old school CRT TV set on a milk crate on the floor near the back of the storefront. Right in front of some hallway with smaller hallways that lead in different directions. I decide to backtrack a few steps and go into the storefront.

I go into the storefront and there’s not much to see or do there. There’s this woman on the floor—in what appears to be some flimsy lingerie—watching the TV set. I walk closer to look at the TV set myself and she rolls aside and over my way to say, “Hello!” When she does that I kneel down to look closer at the TV but also to be at her level near the floor. I say, “Hi…” to her and watch the TV set. She then says, “$4 and you can go downstairs to see that on a bigger, nicer screen…” I politely nod an acknowledgement but don’t take her up on the offer. She then rolls over and spreads her legs and grabs my left arm, “Come on you don’t want to go downstairs? Just $4.” She’s grabs my hand and pushes it into her crotch. I’m not really resisting the effort but I am not into it; I just want to watch the TV. But still I look at her more closely.

She’s cute, but a bit bedraggled. Like she’s been on a few all night benders. But honesly, her crotch looks nice; no hair, but lots of stubble but still nice anyway. I’m rubbing my thumb on her clit and she is saying she likes it, but it all feels so fake and staged; her crotch is drier than leather but I keep rubbing.

She keeps talking about how great it is until I feel a bit of warmth and—sudddenly—her leathery crotch feels a bit damp. Not a lot of moisture but just enough for me to push my thumb in a bit more. Her head leans back and she moans a bit the deeper the thumb goes. I really should be into this but honestly I’m not. I am thinking about going down on her, but the fact this is happening in a storefront is just offputting. But honestly, nobody is really watching use in except that Jewfroed red haired woman outside.

I decide to get closer to her on the floor, and lift one of her legs onto my right shoulder. I feel the stubble rub against my arm, see her stomach move and twitch a bit. Then I wake up.
