## Pizza, a Huge Artist’s Loft and a Cassette Tape

#### Notes on a dream I had on May 28, 2015

I’m walking through some weird arts district. There is this decent pizza place I heard about nearby, but to get to it you have to stoop down through somw weird entry way just below street level.

When I get in there I see people and I see a counter where one can get pizza, but no pizza. A cute woman is nearby quizical about the scenario as well. I tell her she’s cute as well and we sit down. Soon she takes off and says she needs to take care of something. I sit and wait.

I see the pizza guy come out and order two slices; one for me and one for her. Soon she comes back, and I let her know about the pizza and we eat. Afterwards we find our way out of the awkward pizza place and start walking. At some point we are making out. The make out is so good we truly end up in another place.

We are now in some huge artist’s loft. Like something someone in the 1980s would have. Someone else is there and talking about cassette tapes making a comeback and tosses me a tape they made of something. I open up the case and take the tape out. The writing on the case is clean, but when I wipe my fingers across it, it smears and I tell the guy. A while later I get a new copy of the tape and the text is all gold embossed into the plastic. I rub my finger across it and I can’t smear it at all.

I walk around trying to find a cassette tape player to play the cassette and stuble on a handmade tape that has a cover that clearly has my handwriting as well as the handwriting of some co-workers I used to know. Apparently this loft is (was?) the loft of an artist-friend of my former boss and apparently we all signed a cassette to him as a gift.

As I gaze in wonder at the tape, someone who looks vaguely familiar appears. She has red curly hair and is excited I found the tape.  I show it to here and we start making out. I look around for the other woman I came with and she’s gone. I keep on making out with the woman with red curly hair and then show her the cassette. As we look at it, we can see it transform from a cassette tape into some odd old-school mechanical, clockwork-like device.
