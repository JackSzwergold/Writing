## The Scale of the Street Was Humungous

By Jack Szwergold, May 25, 2015

#### Notes on a dream I had on May 25, 2015

I was somehow on a street that looked like Hudson Street near Charlton—near where I used to work—but something was off about it. The scale of the street was humungous. The Pret-A-Manger that used to be on the corner was gutted out, raw and empty. But huge empty space; like an airplane hangar.

Someone suddenly appeared and stood next to me looking into the place and I said to them, “Pret-A-Manger was a pretty big deal when it first opened.” The person looked at me, shrugged and walked off. I tried to find another place to score a sandwich and I found a place nearby.

It was a corner candy store but somehow they were now serving sandwiches that deceptively looked exactly like Pret-A-Manger french bread heros. I asked the guy—who remembered me—what happened and he said, “They went out of business, so now we make sandwiches.” I grabbed one and headed across the street.

The building was weird. It looked like a big museum now. I went into the elevator of the place and that was gigantic. It looked like it was one of those elevators that is used to carry artwork between floors of a museum. I pressed a button and then the doors closed.

The door was made up of jet airplane wings hung vertically. It stopped at lots of floors, but never the one I wanted. And then I woke up.
