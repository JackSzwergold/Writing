## Some Party in an Apartment Somewhere

#### Notes on a dream I had on March 3, 2016

I’m at some party in an apartment somewhere. Sitting on a couch. It’s not that crowded a party but it’s not small either. I’m sitting next to this woman I recognize who is wearing a white dress. We start to make out. I realize it’s someone I had a hook-up with a while back but don’t mention it. She doesn’t recognize me. But we make out.

Flash forward a bit, and I’m awake the next morning on the couch. Nobody else is there and my clothes are a mess. I’m not naked but basically in a t-shirt and shorts. Sun is breaking into the room. I can’t find my stuff like my glasses, wallet and iPhone. So I shout about it. Nobody responds. I shout again and someone comes into the room and points out my stuff is on this dresser. I see them as well as some more of my clothes bunched up on the floor and get myself together again.

I walk outside of the building, look around and before I know it I’m back home. Or is it? I sit on a folding chair and notice it’s leaning to one side. One of the back legs is missing. Also, the folding chair looks weird. The surface is laquered and shiny and there is some kind of leather bagged bladder mechanism beneath the chair. It seems to me some olde-timey noise maker or something. I toss it aside and sit in a regular folding chair.

At some point my apartment turns into another party. This time it’s 100% guys. I’m confused. I stand up and some guy confronts me asking me which way I go. I’m confused and don’t understand. He leans into me with his leg stridling my crotch and he asks again. I get it. I tell him I’m straight; I like women. His face changes and he walks away. I walk through the party and people look disugusted at me.

I find another room and in it I sit down and suddenly some red headed woman I used to know is walking around. It seems like she is performing some physical act with some guy. Not a sexual act but some kind of show. I watch. It’s weird. The man in a top hat is walking around the room and hunched over a bit. She’s wearing a black dress and is hovering behind him. Her pose is like that of a Butoh dancer. The performance ends and they both sit down near me. Suddenly we’re on the roof of an old building. There is paint peeling off of the metal thing on the top of the parapet at the roof’s edge. I peel some of it away and it reveals some old stenciled paint signage for the Columbia Record and Tape club. I point it out to her and we both look at it for a while. And then the dream ends.
