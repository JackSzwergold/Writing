## A Dream About Getting a New Printer

By Jack Szwergold

#### Notes on a dream I had on October 5, 2015

The dream was about me getting a new printer. I have no dreams about getting a new printer in reality, but that was the focus of this dream.

I went on a train someplace to get it, but then couldn’t take it on the train. So it was shipped separately to some package pickup shop where I lived. And I apparently I lived in a rural area.

The package pickup place was sparse. The sun was shining but rain was coming. I got to the place and talked to the guy behind the counter. He pointed to the other side of the shop. And there was the box. I saw it and decided to call my mom and dad. Still the same age I am now, but my parents are alive.

I call them and they tell me they are outside shopping but they will be home soon. I tell them I will be back home soon as I look out the window and see rain coming down and large puddles forming.

I hang up and look outside again. Raining harder. I ask the guy behind the counter what he thinks. He just shrugs. So I go back to the box, pick it up and then head to the door. I look outside and the water has flooded and surrounded the whole lot around the building. Nowhere to go.

I turn to the guy behind the counter and he says, “Well… I guesss we’re stuck here!”

I put down the box and call my parents hoping they are okay. They tell me they’re fine, but they are stuck under a tree somewhere and just waiting for the rain to pass.

I look outside and the rain just keeps on coming.
