# Dreams

This is where I share and post notes on dreams I’ve had. Most of the time my dreams are… Meh. And sometimes my dreams stick with me. Here are notes on those dreams.

## 2015

#### [April 13, 2015: Lucy Ansell is the Name of a Receptionist](Lucy%20Ansell%20is%20the%20Name%20of%20a%20Receptionist)
Lucy Ansell is the name of the receptionist at some cool industrial office. I made out out with her in that cool industrial office after dealing with anti-Semitic restaurant owner dressed in Nazi SS garb.

#### [May 21, 2015: Ordering a Nice Sandwich](Ordering%20a%20Nice%20Sandwich)
I dreamt I was ordering a nice sandwich from a shop, looked around and there was no place to sit.

#### [May 24, 2015: Society for the Blind and Indigent](Society%20for%20the%20Blind%20and%20Indigent)
I met a downstairs neighbor outside the building we live in. Suddenly we are in the middle of a place that looks like Sunset Park and outside a huge place that looks like a mega discount store.

#### [May 25, 2015: The Scale of the Street Was Humongous](The%20Scale%20of%20the%20Street%20Was%20Humongous)
I was somehow on a street that looked like Hudson Street near Charlton—near where I used to work—but something was off about it. The scale of the street was humongous.

#### [May 26, 2015: Michael Jackson Buys the 2nd Floor of My Building](Michael%20Jackson%20Buys%20the%202nd%20Floor%20of%20My%20Building)
Apparently the 2nd floor of the 3 story building I live in was purchased my Michael Jackson as a “pied-à-terre” or something like that. Never mind he’s dead; nobody was acknowledging that well known fact.

#### [May 28, 2015: Pizza, a Huge Loft and a Cassette Tape](Pizza,%20a%20Huge%20Loft%20and%20a%20Cassette%20Tape)
I’m walking through some weird arts district. There is this decent pizza place I heard about nearby, but to get to it you have to stoop down through somw weird entry way just below street level.

#### [June 15, 2015: The Asian Guy, the Hispanic Guy and a Toothpaste Tube](The%20Asian%20Guy,%20the%20Hispanic%20Guy%20and%20a%20Toothpaste%20Tube)
I don’t rememeber much of it but near the end—before I woke up—there are two guys sitting on what looks like a couch in a crammed area. One is Asian, the other is Hispanic. They keep on passing this toothpaste tube between them.

#### [August 8, 2015: Running into Amy at the Home Depot](Running%20into%20Amy%20at%20the%20Home%20Depot)
I’m at some Home Depot but not a good one. One of those “lightweight” city dweller Home Depots. Some guy who works there asks me a question about what I am looking for, I am describing it and then he instantly writes me up for something.

#### [September 26, 2015: Someplace in Murray Hill or Kips Bay](Someplace%20in%20Murray%20Hill%20or%20Kips%20Bay)
I’m somehow in some apartment. We’re in the present day, but the apartment looks like it was decorated in the 1970s or so.

#### [October 5, 2015: A Dream About Getting a New Printer](A%20Dream%20About%20Getting%20a%20New%20Printer)
The dream was about me getting a new printer. I have no dreams about getting a new printer in reality, but that was the focus of this dream.

#### [November 18, 2015: A Storefront on a Dumpy Street](A%20Storefront%20on%20a%20Dumpy%20Street)
I get up and start walking down a fairly nice—yet dumpy—street. There is some rack of women’s clothes in front of it and this big red-haired girl with a Jewfro out in front of the rack just acting silly.

## 2016

#### [March 3, 2016: Some Party in an Apartment Somewhere](Some%20Party%20in%20an%20Apartment%20Somewhere)
I’m at some party in an apartment somewhere. Sitting on a couch. It’s not that crowded a party but it’s not small either. I’m sitting next to this woman I recognize who is wearing a white dress.

#### [June 6, 2016: An Odd Penny on a Subway Car](An%20Odd%20Penny%20on%20a%20Subway%20Car)
I am sitting on a subway train and see what looks like a penny on the floor. I lift myself out of the seat, lean over and pick it up. But as I look closer at the coin, I notice that it’s not really a penny but rather a modified penny.

#### [June 7, 2016: A Silver Dollar and a Half Dollar Coin](A%20Silver%20Dollar%20and%20a%20Half%20Dollar%20Coin)
I dream I have a silver dollar and a half dollar coin. But not any ordinary silver dollar and half dollar coins since these coins are heavy, thick and huge; like as huge as two small dinner plates.
