# Dreams

This is where I share and post notes on dreams I’ve had. Most of the time my dreams are… Meh. And sometimes my dreams stick with me. Here are notes on those dreams.

#### [April 13, 2015: Lucy Ansell is the Name of a Receptionist](Lucy%20Ansell%20is%20the%20Name%20of%20a%20Receptionist)
Lucy Ansell is the name of the receptionist at some cool industrial office. I made out out with her in that cool industrial office after dealing with anti-Semitic restaurant owner dressed in Nazi SS garb.

#### [June 15, 2015: The Asian Guy, the Hispanic Guy and a Toothpaste Tube](The%20Asian%20Guy,%20the%20Hispanic%20Guy%20and%20a%20Toothpaste%20Tube)
I don’t rememeber much of it but near the end—before I woke up—there are two guys sitting on what looks like a couch in a crammed area. One is Asian, the other is Hispanic. They keep on passing this toothpaste tube between them.

#### [September 26, 2015: Someplace in Murray Hill or Kips Bay](Someplace%20in%20Murray%20Hill%20or%20Kips%20Bay)
I’m somehow in some apartment. We’re in the present day, but the apartment looks like it was decorated in the 1970s or so.

#### [October 5, 2015: A Dream About Getting a New Printer](A%20Dream%20About%20Getting%20a%20New%20Printer)
The dream was about me getting a new printer. I have no dreams about getting a new printer in reality, but that was the focus of this dream.

#### [November 18, 2015: A Storefront on a Dumpy Street](A%20Storefront%20on%20a%20Dumpy%20Street)
I get up and start walking down a fairly nice—yet dumpy—street. There is some rack of women’s clothes in front of it and this big red-haired girl with a Jewfro out in front of the rack just acting silly.

#### [March 3, 2016: Some Party in an Apartment Somewhere](Some%20Party%20in%20an%20Apartment%20Somewhere)
I’m at some party in an apartment somewhere. Sitting on a couch. It’s not that crowded a party but it’s not small either. I’m sitting next to this woman I recognize who is wearing a white dress.
