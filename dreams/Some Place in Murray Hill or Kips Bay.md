## Some Place in Murray Hill or Kips Bay

#### Notes on a dream I had on September 26, 2015

I’m somehow in some apartment. We’re in the present day, but the apartment looks like it was decorated in the 1970s or so. Lots of brown fixtures and gold trim. But it’s not exactly nice. It’s a bit dingy. Looks like a place in Murray Hill or Kips Bay. There’s shaggish carpeting but it’s worn down.

I think I’m there to help someone and I have helped them. They thank me. It’s all women. About 3 or 4 of them. Just basically lounging around. Not in a sexy way or even a non sexy way. Just lounging. I notice some details in the apartment I never noticed before. Like some art on the walls. Screenprints of some kind of comic book kinda stuff. But nothing really recgnizable. It’s like some of that street art stuff that’s been canned, filtered and placed on a wall. Wondering what this place is?

So anyway, at some point they say I gotta go. But they are not forceful about it. Soon some people show up at the front door. Everyone greets each other and just gets comfortable in the place. That’s when I notice a wall disappear and there’s a bar and a lunch counter of some sort. Not a big version of either thing, but still that’s clearly what they are. In this apartment.

More people show up and it starts to feel like a bar. Someone mentions somthing about “*Buddy’s*” and I ask one of the women from the beginning, “What is this?” And she responds, “This is *Buddy’s*”  and I start to realize this is some weird speakeasy. But they are just serving beer and chips and cheap sandwiches. Kind of stuff you’d find at an Veteran’s hall or some bowling alley.

So I mingle a bit but it feels weird, so I head to the elevators. They are weird looking elevators. Somewhat hexagonical, but stretched wide. I walk in and the thing is wood panelling  and there’s no obvious buttons to push to get the elevator to work. I open a panel up and it’s dingy but there is something that looks like a telephone push button pad; like someone shoved a calculator into the wall. I press some buttons but nothing works.

Then I hear some guys walking towards the elevator from one of the sides of the elevator opposite of where I walked in. Thne a door opens. A couple of very well dressed black men who have a thick accent but speak in English walk in. They are talking to each other and then look at me in disdain for not knowing how to work the elevator. They push some other panel open and there I see what looks like normal elevator controls. One of the guys hits the “L” button and suddenly the elevator starts moving and heading downstairs.
