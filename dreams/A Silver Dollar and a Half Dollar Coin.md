## A Silver Dollar and a Half Dollar Coin

By Jack Szwergold

#### Notes on a dream I had on June 7, 2016

I don’t remember the complete flow—or overall narrative—of this dream but it contained imagery surrounding coins.

I dream I have a silver dollar and a half dollar coin. But not any ordinary silver dollar and half dollar coins since these coins are heavy, thick and huge; like as huge as two small dinner plates.

I bring them to some place and put them on top of some books on a counter. As I do that a crack appears in the silver dollar. It’s a small—but noticeable—crack and it grows to cut across the coin as I move it forward to the woman behind the counter who will assess it for me.

She tells me the half dollar coin is in excellent shape, and worth something; but nothing to get too excited about. But the silver dollar was rarer and worth far more than the half dollar coin but—sadly—not in the condition it's in; it’s now completely split in half.

She passes the coins back to me and they seem heavier and larger than they were before. I look at the split edge of the silver dollar and the core is nice, shiny and clean. But sadly it’s not worth much split in half.
