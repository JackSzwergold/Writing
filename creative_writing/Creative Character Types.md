## Outraged Ineffectual Enabler

Someone in a group who is outraged at some behavior in the group, but is ultimately an ineffective enabler of that behavior.

Their fortune would be, “You experience outrage; mainly in groups or alone in response to something on social media. You make sure anyone and everyone knows about your outrage in loaded questions which test others on their social outrage. If they are not as outraged as you, you are Now outraged at them; the circle is endless. But while you are outraged you, at best, do nothing to change the situation or you, at worst, actually enable the dysfunctional behavior via inaction.”

## Armchair Contrarian Publicist

Someone who is constantly shilling for bands–hipster otherwise–often in response to someone proclaiming they like something.

Their fortune would be, “Always ready to recommend something nobody wants to hear like a big box retail employee wants to always sell you an extended warranty. Always believes newer is better. Won’t take no for an answer. Doesn’t work for the band or the label yet has an encyclopedic knowledge of their output throughout the years. Derides anything that is not hip or cool. Will follow you around the bar/venue to assert their trendy knowledge but you never have enough time or space alone to properly slap them.”

## Indignant Entitled Jogger

Neighborhood jogger who feels entitled to just blow by—and even physically push people—as they jog around the neighborhood they claim as theirs despite only moving in a year or so ago.

Their fortune would be, “The world is your oyster as long as you are in your running shoes. Nothing can get in your way because you and just run around them, push them with your sweaty elbow and even yell at them without fear of reprisal. When others wait at the crosswalk to cross the street you can simply push through, jog in place and check your health vitals on your iPhone. If you run into one of your jogging brethren, feel free to stand their and jog in place and share notes on work, school, the kids, nannies and maybe your wives. Always lecture on diet when you can and then quickly jog away.” 

## Protestant Hipster

A hipster who is “edgy” in an extremely Protestant way.

## Entitled Eco-Friendly Sociopath

Nuff said.

## Exasperated Unchallenged Entitlement

## Elegant Voyeur

## Hipster Masochist

Hipster who is contrarian to the point of self destructing and is blind to narcissism in their idols.

## Orthodox Hipster

The idea that you can only validly enjoy something if you have discovered it in the correct, often unwritten order put forth by people you don’t know.

## Dark Noise Hippie

A goth who likes to noodle around making noise music of some kind, but never really aspires to doing more.

## Hipster Homebody/Suburban Shut-In

Kinda like the “cool mom/dad” but they don’t realize they are the cool mom/dad. Everybody’s jealous of them.

## Humble Narcissist

Person acts kind, humble and deferential in many situations until an opportunity comes to be a narcissist and then they turn on a dime.
