# The Ten Commandments of Elementary School

* **Thou shall honor me, thine Lord and savior, at all times.** Not just during tests or trying to will school crushes into existence. I’m tired of hearing about your school crushes.
* **Thou shall share thine designated hiding place if a shooter enters the school building.** It is the only fair thing to do, even if your classmates are lame or stupid. You and your classmates don’t deserve to be a shooters victim.
* **Thou shall not covet thy classmates lunch.** It’s just silly. Especially because you should be so lucky to afford lunch to begin with.
* **Thou shall not hog the water fountain.** Take a sip and just walk away. Don’t loiter. You’re not Joe Cool and Joe’s not that cool anyway. He’s kinda creepy.
* **Thou shall not chew your pen or pencil.** Pens and penicls don’t grow on trees! They cost good money; don’t chew your pen or pencil.
* **Thou shall show sympathy to your classmates who are injured or suffering in some other way.** That one kid who always has nose bleeds or needs to throw up all the time or has asthma needs your friendship.
* **Thou shall always wear proper footwear.** No slides or flip-flops. Nobody wants to see your bare feat.
* **Thou shall not be a weirdo.** Be cool even if you’re not cool. Cool?
* **Thou shall fully own thine farts.** You smelt it; you dealt it. No negotiations.
* **Thou shall not alienate the one designated as “it.”** And if you are “it?” You should appropriately tag someone else so they deal with the burden of being “it.”
