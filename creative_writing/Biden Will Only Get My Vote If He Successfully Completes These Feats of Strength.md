# Biden Will Only Get My Vote If He Successfully Completes These Feats of Strength

* **Arm Wrestling**: Joe Biden and Donald Trump go at it in the classic head to head battle between men. Mano a Mano. Best of three wins.
* **Drags a Train or a Truck with his Teeth**. Joe Biden gets to pull a significantly weighed down train or truck with his teeth. His choice. He has to pull it for one yard. Kamala Harris and Jill Biden can pump up the crowds.
* **Cannonball is Shot at his Stomach**: Much like venerated vaudeville star, Frank Richards, Joe Biden will allow a cannonball to be shot at his stomach at fairly close range. The contest is won if he survives the blow and walks away on his own two feet.
* **Base jump off of the Freedom Tower.** While band plays the Star Spangled Banner, Joe Biden will base jump off of the highest point of the Freedom Tower in NYC. If successful, he will gracefully land, via parachute, on the ground below.
* **Wrestling a grizzly bear or a shark.** The choice of bear or shark is up the President Biden himself. While Biden will most likely be injured or scathed in the ensuing battle, victory will be judged if he can pummel the bear or shark into submission.
* **Putting food all over his body and allowing raccoons to eat off of his body.** I once saw a video of a woman in San Francisco, California or Portland, Oregon who did this and it looked really cool as well as harrowing. I think Biden can and should attempt such a stunt as Kamala Harris and Jill Biden cheers him on.
* **Crush a full can (soda, beer, beans, etc…) with one hand.** As it
* **Bend a steel beam with his bare hands and/or teeth.**
* **Tear a deck of cards in two with his bare hands.**
* **Juggle barbells.**
* **Drive nails into a piece of wood with his bare hands.**
* **Carry a piano up a set of stairs.**
* **Tear a phone book or two.** But since phone books aren’t as big as they once were, tear a copy of “Infinite Jest” or the “Power Broker” in two.
* **Eats a can of spinach and does 20 oush-ups in the oval office.** Just like Popeye, Biden will sit and eat a can of spinach in the oval office. When hie finishes, he stands and takes off his shirt to reveal he new pumped up physique. Then, an impersonator dressed as Donald Trump enters the oval office, says some nonsense and is immediately knocked out by Biden. Then Biden hits the ground and does a series of push ups; some one handed and a few with claps mixed in.
