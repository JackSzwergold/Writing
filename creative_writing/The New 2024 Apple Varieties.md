# The New 2024 Apple Varieties

Fall has arrived and so have the new 2024 apple varieties!

* **Bloody McIntosh**: All the tart, sweet flavor of a classic McIntosh apple but with filled with juicy blood.
* **Grandpa Smith**: The crispness of a Granny Smith, but surrounded by a bitter leathery skin.
* **Zenyatta**: A bold, flavorful apple colored orange, yellow and blue just like the cover of the Police’s classic 1980 album.
* **Juicy Judicial**: A delicate, juicy variety of apple inspired by Supreme Court justice’s Thomas, Alito and Roberts.
* **Raisin Cane**: A horrifically bitter, deep red variety that tastes like raisins and causes temporary diarrhea.
* **Cameo 86**: A delightful variant of the classic sweet and tart Cameo apple, but it plays the refrain from the 1986 hit song “Word Up!” with each bite.
* **Golden Delicious Ranch**: A delightful blend of a sweet golden delicious apple with tangy ranch flavor.
* **Crapple**: Four out of five crapples are delicious and seedless. The 5th crappie is just rank and filled to the brim with seeds.
