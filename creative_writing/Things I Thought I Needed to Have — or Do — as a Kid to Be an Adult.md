# Things I Thought I Needed to Have — or Do — as a Kid to Be an Adult

* **Have an alimony.** In the 1980s everyone on sitcoms, had alimonies. Why not me? 
* **Have a mortgage.** Everyone complained about mortgages on TV. Why not me?
* **Have bills.** Everyone had bills back in the day; not just ducks. Why not me?
* **Have a curfew.** In the 1970s and 1980s, everyone on TV had a curfew? I didn’t? Why not!
* **Have a hernia.** Every old guy on TV shows in the 1970s and 1980s had a hernia; whatever that is. Why not me?
* **Have amnesia.** Everyone on TV shows in the 1970s and 1980s would get  bonked on the head and then get amnesia. All I got with a bonk on the head was pain; why couldn’t I get amnesia?
* **Have lumbago.** Every old guy on TV shows in the 1970s and 1980s had a lumbago; whatever that is. Why not me?
* **Have a goiter.** Lots of old people in my Brooklyn neighborhood had goiters. I didn’t want them. A big bulge on your neck? Nope! They looked gross.
* **Own a Ming Vase.** Every single sitcom I watched growing up featured a Ming (dynasty) vase being put in a precarious situation. Why can’t I ever live in a home that has enough room to place a Ming vase, on a fancy plinth, in it?
* **Have a quiche.** In the 1970s and 1980s, everyone on TV had quiche. They never ate normal food like Salisbury steaks or tater tots. Why can’t I eat a quiche?
* **Have fondue.** In the 1970s and 1980s, everyone on TV seemingly had fondue. Well, maybe not everyone. Maybe just the Ropers on “Three’s Company.” Maybe Helen Roper likes Fondue. I dunno.
* **Get a birthday crown from Burger King.** Every kid in the 1970s and 1980s got a birthday crown from Burger King. I couldn’t get one if I wanted one anyway because there were no Burger Kings where I lived back then. Oh well!
* **Go on a trip to Disneyland / Disney World.** Every kid in the 1970s and 1980s got to go to Disneyland / Disney World. I never liked Disney things as a kid, so I guess Coney Island was for me.
* **Join the French Foreign Legion.** Everyone from Pepe Le Pew to Laurel and Hardy back in the day joined the French Foreign Legion. And Laurel and Hardy didn’t know French! I guess I dodged a bullet with that one.
