# Spoilered (Rich Kid Shares the Marvel Comics Adaptation of Return of the Jedi)

By Jack Szwergold, May 30, 2015

David was this rich kid who lived in Manhattan Beach. I knew him in junior high school. Maybe “rich” isn’t the best word to describe the kid. Maybe “entitled” is a better description of who he was and possibly still is. But compared to the kids from Brighton Beach, kids in Manhattan Beach were fairly rich and entitled across the board.

To understand the politics of the situation, the junior high school we went to straddled the border between Manhattan Beach and Brighton Beach near the edge of Sheepshead Bay. While Brighton Beach was filled with pre-war tenements, ratty single family homes and even rattier bungalows that had no heat or hot water which were left-over from the time when the neighborhood was still a vacation destination community, Manhattan Beach was pretty much the closest thing to the “suburbs” I knew as a kid. The lawns were clean, people owned nice cars—as well as garages to put them in—and generally the neighborhood seemed cleaner and more “normal” than anything one would see in Brighton Beach. And junior high school was the place where—thanks to NYC Board of Education zoning as well as the “gifted and talented” program—some kids from Brighton Beach got to mingle with the kids from Manhattan Beach.

Now back to David.

David lived in Manhattan Beach and seemed to always be wearing the cleanest, hippest, preppiest clothes money could buy. The first time I ever saw an Izod Lacoste embroidered alligator logo sweater he was wearing it. He was scruffy in an urban preppie kind of way, but also clean and pretty cool at times. One of the first open acts of kindness he bestowed on me and other kid from Brighton Beach when we first arrived at the school was giving us a mix-tape that featured songs like *The Buggles’* “Video Killed the Radio Star,” *OMD*’s “Enola Gay” as well as *Sparks’* “This Town Ain’t Big Enough for Both of Us.”

We soon found out why he was so cool and generous: His brother worked for a major media company in the city and he would just get tons of stuff all the time from his brother. Stuff his brother was working on, stuff his brother was reviewing, stuff his brother was given as promotional swag just because. Just tons of stuff. And the stuff he wasn’t explicitly given he just had access to thanks to his position in the entertainment world.

For example, in 1982 when Eddie Murphy was starring in *48 Hrs.*, guess who showed off his bootleg copy of the film on Betamax to the class? David did. While few people owned VCRs back then this kid not only had access to a Betamax deck, he also had enough industry access to score a bootleg copy of *48 Hrs.* in an era when movie bootlegging was far from common to say the least. He also was able to get his hands on a pre-release copy of the video game *Berserk* for the Atari 2600 as well and show that off in class. The kid was well connected.

So one spring day in homeroom in 1983 before *Return of the Jedi* was released, he showed up with a copy of the official Marvel comics adaptation of the movie to share with all of us. For the first time in my life, a film was “spoiled.”

We all eagerly huddled around a desk and gawked at the pictures and the story. Everyone soon learned that by the end of the film a new Death Star would be destroyed, Darth Vader would die and—for the first time in the series—Darth Vader would be unmasked so we could see what his real face actually looked like. Now granted, the Marvel comics adaptation creatively dodged any specific details of what Darth Vader’s real face actually looked like. So I could still look forward to being surprised by that little tidbit when I saw the movie on a big screen. But for all intents and purposes, the experience of seeing *Return of the Jedi* was now officially spoiled for me.

That said, I can’t blame David entirely for spoiling *Return of the Jedi* by sharing that Marvel comics adaptation with everyone.

A short while later later—while I checked out magazines and comics at a local, dumpy, non-special newsstand—I spotted the exact same Marvel comics adaptation of *Return of the Jedi* up for sale a few weeks before the film was officially scheduled to be released. So I did what any eager *Star Wars* fan would do: I bought it. And then a week or so after that, the official Marvel comics movie program for *Return of the Jedi* was officially on sale as well at the same dumpy newsstand. So I bought that too.

The thing I liked the most about *Star Wars* and *The Empire Strikes Back* was the way I discovered and initially experienced both films: *Star Wars* was the unexpected hit that came out of nowhere and *The Empire Strikes Back* was the sequel that exceeded everyone’s expectations for a follow-up film. Both films surprised fans in some unique way and never felt over marketed for what they were. In contrast, the marketing push around the release of *Return of the Jedi* seemed crass, arrogant and well coordinated.

I mean yes, this was still *Star Wars* we]re talking about. So you could buy all kinds of books, toys, cards, action figures, souvenirs and junk to satisfy your fan desires if you wanted to. But despite the monumental success of both *Star Wars* films, from my childhood perspective it never seemed like there was a big—or very well coordinated—merchandising push behind the first two *Star Wars* films. Or at least a merchandising push that was so intensely well coordinated that the full, uncensored plot of the unreleased film could be deliberately made for sale in a legally purchasable form weeks before the actual film itself even hit theaters and that was somehow okay.

And with that said, my personal enjoyment of *Star Wars* ended with *Return of the Jedi* and the pre-Internet media over-saturation I experienced during that film’s initial release. Part of me wants to blame David for sharing his copy of the official Marvel comics adaptation of *Return of the Jedi* with everyone else in our junior high school class. But—when all is said and done—by the time 1983 rolled around *Star Wars* was no longer a magically unique, nascent series of science fiction films that inspired wonder and amazement. *Star Wars* had officially transformed itself into a Hollywood cash cow franchise whose only job was to crassly push viewers emotional buttons and sell them merchandise.

And I was getting too old for that sort of thing.
