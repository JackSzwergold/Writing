## Going to See the Shaggy DA in Times Square in the 1970s with My Dad
### About the Time I Went to See the Shaggy DA with My Dad in Times Square and Got to Actually Meet the Shaggy DA Himself

By Jack Szwergold

I really liked reading the Sunday newspaper in the 1970s. And by “reading” I mean “flipping through” and by “Sunday newspaper” I mean *The New York Daily News*.

*The Daily News* was the only newspaper in my home back in the 1970s. At least it was the only newspaper on most days my dad could get it; on those rare days it was sold out my dad would grab a copy of *The New York Post*; but that is neither here nor there.

On Sundays in my parent’s home it was the Sunday *Daily News* and not much else.

I typically would scour through the comics and sales circulars getting some entertainment from either reading the comics or day dreaming about toys I could not afford. Sometimes I would flip through the movie section to see what was coming out.

Looking through movie ads in a newspaper like the *Daily News* back then was a weird experience. While a movie ratings system was still in place, ads for G rated films were typically placed right next to more adult oriented PG and R rated films. Sometimes even X rated films!

Generally, most of the films out at the time didn’t really appeal to me at the time. I liked cartoons and other short, ephemeral stuff you could catch on TV so movies seemed like more of an adult thing to me anyway.
