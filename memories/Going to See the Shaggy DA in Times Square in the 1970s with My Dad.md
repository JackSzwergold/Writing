## Going to See the Shaggy DA in Times Square in the 1970s with My Dad
### About the Time I Went to See the Shaggy DA with My Dad in Times Square and Got to Actually Meet the Shaggy DA Himself

By Jack Szwergold

I really liked reading the Sunday newspaper in the 1970s. And by “reading” I mean “flipping through.” And by “Sunday newspaper” I mean *The New York Daily News*. *The Daily News* was the only newspaper in our home back in the 1970s.

At least it was the only newspaper on the days my dad could get it. On those rare days my dad decided to buy it later in the day—and by then it was sold out—he would just grab a copy of *The New York Post* as a stop-gap measure… But none of that is neither here nor there.

On Sundays in our home it was the Sunday *Daily News* and not much else. And I‘m not complaining!

I typically would scour through the comics and colorful sales circulars to squeeze some entertainment out of that pile of newsprint. The comics sated my need for colorful pictures and corny jokes while the sales circulars filled my head with the dreams of things (mostly toys) I might—and might not—be able to afford with my meager childhood allowances.

But sometimes I would flip through the movie section to see what movies were coming out. And looking through movie ads in a working class newspaper like the *Daily News* back then was a weird experience for a kid.

While there technically was an MPAA movie ratings system in place at the time, that was mainly to control who could see movies in a theater. It didn’t really cover where ads were actually placed in newspapers. And ads for movies of all kinds seemed to be placed arbitrarilly at best in newspapers back then. Sometimes ads for G rated films were placed right next to more adult oriented PG or R rated films… And sometimes even next to X rated films!

As a 7 year old kid, most of the films out at the time didn’t really appeal to me. I liked cartoons and other short attention span—and many literally short—ephemeral stuff you could catch on TV. So movies always seemed like more of an adult thing to me anyway.

But on that specific Sunday I saw an ad for a movie that blew my mind: It was for “The Shaggy D.A.!” I had no idea what the movie was about didn’t care becausse two key things grabbed my attention: One, this was a movie that featured a dog as a lawyer and two, this particular screening of the movie would give me the opportunity to meet Goofy in person! My mind was blown! I had to see this movie!

I ran over to my dad and entusiastically showed him the ad, “I want to see this movie!” I said as I pointed my tiny newsprint covered fingers to the ad for “The Shaggy D.A.” that had a special appearance by Goofy.

My dad wasn’t incredulous, dismissive, exasperated or patronizing but took my request seriously. He lifted up the paper, looked at the ad and said “So this is next weekend, right?” he said. “So we’ll go then, okay?” he added and I nodded.

He put down the newspaper on the living room coffee table, circled the ad with a blue ballpoint pen and gave the movie section back to me.

I was thrilled and happy as I looked at the ad with the fresh circle of blue ink around it.

A week passed and we were ready to head into “The City” to see “The Shaggy D.A.” It was an overcast—and somewhat dreary—winter day and the D train ride to Times Square was kinda quiet and calm.

We got off at Times Square and—as typical—I was enthralled an confused by all of the lights, dirt, grime and general disrepair of the area at the time. On the one hand, there was some kind of arcades and entertainment around, but for a small 7 year old kid this was a somewhat scary place. I so I made sure to hold my dad’s hand as we made our way to the movie theater.

The movie theater itself was truly a dumpy black-box grind-house of a theater. While it was—in some ways—similar to the dumpy theaters I had seen in my then short life in Brooklyn, those were mainly just aging and falling apart. In contrast this Times Square theater seemed beat up and vandalized. But I didn’t feel unsafe in there; just unimpressed that this would be the place where I would meet the legendary Goofy himself in person.

We sat down and got ready to watch the film. The audience consisted of an array of parents and kids all waiting for the same reason: To see the film and to meet Goofy.

It wasn’t clear whether Goofy would come out before or after the film. So we all sat and waited. And then—with little fanfare—the film began. And you know what? It really stunk. I have no idea to this day what the plot was but will say this: The second the dog lawyer showed with his briefcase—and sometimes wearing a hat—I was into that. But past that, I couldn’t wait for the film to end.

And when it ended, I was relieved. The lights came up and someone up front in an official looking usher outfit basically announced that Goofy was here to greet people. And all the kids were excited.

There, running up the aisle and adjusting his “head” with his big, white Goofy gloves every few seconds was Goofy himself. Goofy didn’t give out anything I remembered, but he would stop and pose for pictures as well as shake hands. My dad didn’t have a camera back then, so we just waited for Goofy to come by and shake our hands.

Goofy came close to me, grabbed my hand and shook it pretty violently. I mean I was a 7 year old kid at the time and felt it all the way up to my shoulder. He shook my dad’s hand as well and—to his credit—my dad feigned excitement when he exclaimed with excitement that he had just met Goofy.

Soon enough, Goofy disappeared out the front door of the theater and so did the rest of us.

Walking back to the subway after the encounter was just as creepy and odd as it was walking to the theater. We passed Nathan’s and my dad asked if I was hungry and I shook my head “No!” and with that we headed back to the D train and back home to Brighton Beach.
