So I figured out how to explain my experience with my parents simply.

First, the foundation of my parents life is World War II and the Holocaust. My mom was on the run all her teenage years from around 13 (1938) to 20 (1945). They met in the rubble of Poland. He was a soldier in the Polish Army; a division specifically made up of Polish Russian labor camp prisoners.

So that is the trauma they both had.

Flash forward to life in the U.S.: My dad worked in a box factory in Williamsburg. Then in the 1970s he went in disability and lost his job and the Union didn’t help him because he never reached a magical 15 years for benefits.

With me around as a kid, she got jobs working in sweatshops. The last one is one that was located in Gowanus.

My dad always had heart issues and in the early 1980s and had open heart surgey for a bypass.

My mom just kept in working.

In the early 1990s she started acting “weird.” Turns out she had tons of strokes.

In May of 1993 she became unresponsive one day. She could get up and walk, but couldn’t speak. My dad could walk her around the apartment we lived in but she was clearly not all there.

She was checked into Coney Island Hospital where she improved in some ways, but was not verbal. Lots of eye and face gestures. But not all there.

I spent time in the hospital but eventually took a trip to Madison, WI to visit friends. A few hours later she passed away and I flew back home.

Here is my dad’s story.

He became depressed and his health decayed as well. Alarmingly so.

At one point we had him checked into nursing facilities at Maimonides in Borough Park.

An utter nightmare. Shitty staff that treated him like cattle.

Then to make matters worse, he was diagnosed with AIDS. He contracted it from tainted blood given to him during the open heart surgery he had a decade earlier.

The family was shocked. My dad was in denial. But orderlies who would wheel him around and just casually turn to me and say, “I hear pops here got AIDS from the hospital. You should sue!”

The called him “pops” because they were assholes. And they would talk like this despite my dad clearly curling up and crying and screaming. They can all rot in hell.

The day he passed away I ate at a nearby diner. Finished my meal, headed to his room. My brother and sister were there and my dad was literally on his last breaths.

I held his hand and cried until I heard the death rattle. My brother and sister ran to hug each other, but I was shunned and screamed at.

We had to fight and scream at the staff to stop them from doing an autopsy on him. He died of AIDS so they routinely did that but it would not work for us and a Jewish funeral.

Anyway thank you for reading and saying you are cool with me sharing. I truly appreciate it.

The big lesson I learned is that you always need a family member there in the hospital. And if your siblings are supportive? All the better.

Keep the toxicity out and keep the positivity in and nurture it.

Best of thoughts and strength to you and your family. You’re a good soul.
