# Kittens in the Alley

**Quick Notes**: Running in and around the basement ways and alleys around our building and then stumbling on about three to four small, orange kittens next to a bunch of cooked chicken bones in tin foil. Maggots were crawling all over the chicken and the kittens were mewing nearby and with some maggots crawling on their face and eyes.
