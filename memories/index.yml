title_short: Memories
description: Here are some personal memories of mine; written down for all to read. Pretty much everything in there at this point relates to my experiences growing up in Brooklyn, New York. But I’m not calling it a “memoir” just yet because that word is a tad pompous and pretentious; but honestly that’s what it might be at this point.
