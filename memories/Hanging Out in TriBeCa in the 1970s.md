## Hanging Out in TriBeCa in the 1970s

By Jack Szwergold

Call me cool, but back when I was 9 or 10 years old I hung out in TriBeCa.

Not at the Mudd Club or anything like that but in a huge factory just South of Canal Street.

It was a garment factory and my mom, dad and I heaed out from the ass end of Brooklyn to TriBeCa to look for work.

We all took the train out one Satuday morning. I was grey and overcast. The subway was one of those rickety old cars that was kinda corrugated on the side. The trip was fun. I liked looking out the windows. Especially the window of the first car. Iâ€™d get excited toys, balls and junk
