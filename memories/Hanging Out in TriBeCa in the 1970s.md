## Hanging Out in TriBeCa in the 1970s

By Jack Szwergold

Call me cool, but back in 1975 or 1976 when I was 7 or 8 years old I hung out in TriBeCa.

Not at the Mudd Club or anything like that but in a huge factory just South of Canal Street.

It was a garment factory and my mom, dad and I heaed out from the ass end of Brooklyn to TriBeCa to look for work.

We all took the train out one Satuday morning. I was grey and overcast. The subway was one of those rickety old cars that was kinda corrugated on the side. The trip was fun. I liked looking out the windows. Especially the window of the first car. I’d get excited toys, balls and junk on the tracks and had fantasies of getting off at a nearby stop, running onto the tracks and scoring some free toys.

But that was not to be. First, I was too young and would get hit by a train and die. Second, we needed to head into Manhattan to see if my mom could get a job in a schmata factory.

My dad was essentially laid off due to disability
