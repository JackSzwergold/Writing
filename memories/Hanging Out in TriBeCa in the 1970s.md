## Hanging Out in TriBeCa in the 1970s

By Jack Szwergold

Call me cool, but back in 1975 or 1976 when I was 7 or 8 years old I hung out in TriBeCa.

Not at the Mudd Club or anything like that but in a huge factory just South of Canal Street.

It was a garment factory and my mom, dad and I heaed out from the ass end of Brooklyn to TriBeCa to look for work.

We all took the train out one Satuday morning. I was grey and overcast. The subway was one of those rickety old cars that was kinda corrugated on the side. The trip was fun. I liked looking out the windows. Especially the window of the first car. I’d get excited toys, balls and junk on the tracks and had fantasies of getting off at a nearby stop, running onto the tracks and scoring some free toys.

But that was not to be. First, I was too young and would get hit by a train and die. Second, we needed to head into Manhattan to see if my mom could get a job in a schmata factory.

My dad was essentially laid off due to disability from having a heart attack in 1975. And he wasn’t in the Union long enough to actually around like hawks because this was the classic gritty NYC of the 1970s. Abe Beame’s shithole. The city I grew up in. A genuinely dangerous place.

But I looked around and soaked in what I could. Like
