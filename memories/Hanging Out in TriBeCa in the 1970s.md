## Hanging Out in TriBeCa in the 1970s

By Jack Szwergold

Call me cool, but back in 1975 or 1976 when I was 7 or 8 years old I hung out in TriBeCa.

Not at the Mudd Club or anything like that but in a huge factory just South of Canal Street.

It was a garment factory and my mom, dad and I heaed out from the ass end of Brooklyn to TriBeCa to look for work.

We all took the train out one Satuday morning. I was grey and overcast. The subway was one of those rickety old cars that was kinda corrugated on the side. The trip was fun. I liked looking out the windows. Especially the window of the first car. I’d get excited toys, balls and junk on the tracks and had fantasies of getting off at a nearby stop, running onto the tracks and scoring some free toys.

But that was not to be. First, I was too young and would get hit by a train and die. Second, we needed to head into Manhattan to see if my mom could get a job in a schmata factory.

My dad was essentially laid off due to disability from having a heart attack in 1975. And he wasn’t in the Union long enough to actually around like hawks because this was the classic gritty NYC of the 1970s. Abe Beame’s shithole. The city I grew up in. A genuinely dangerous place.

But I looked around and soaked in what I could. Like Dave’s Luncheonette on the corner. It looked so fancy and cool. But we never stopped in. We just swung onto Broadway and walked a few blocks down, up some dingy staircase and only the darkened—but still lit—factory floor. Light streamed in from whatever windows were still there.

I remember seeing rows upon rows of sewing machines. Nobody seemed to be there yet we walked in as if it were no issue.

My dad shouted “Hello!” and it echoed throughout the floor. We all heard some shuffling from the back and a person appeared at the very end of the factory floor and asked “What?”

My mom and dad looked at each other and looked at me and told me to stay up front. I nodded a “Yes…” and with that they walked to the back of the factory where that guy was.

I meandered around up front, not wandering too far out of sight of my parents, but not really standing still either. I peered around and peeked around to see what I could see. I was a kid so I was looking for some cool stuff to shove in my pocket, but all I saw were miscellaneous things like screws, nails, sewing machine needs and old-school cans of oil. Nothing worth much of anything to me.

I heard looked back down the aisle to my parents talking to the factory guy. I could hear them speak to him in Yiddish and saw lots of gesticulation. Hand motions and such. The discussion was passionate but not crazy or angry. Clearly some kind of negotiation.

After a while my mom and dad came up front and the guy followed. When they came up front my dad said, “Okay time to go home.” The guy looked at me, looked at my parents and just shrugged. It wasn’t a judgemental shrug, but my parents had me in their 40s and at the time of this encounter they were in their early 50s. I looked more like I should be their grandson at the time; not their son.

Pretty sure my parents dragged me along to score some sympathy points. I mean, showing off a kid as a dependent for a job is a thing,
