## Hanging Out in TriBeCa in the 1970s

By Jack Szwergold

If you want to call me a cool kid, please do. You see, back in 1975 or 1976—when I was 7 or 8 years old—I visited  TriBeCa for the first time… With my mom and dad.

Not at the Mudd Club or Artist’s Spaceor anything like that but in a huge factory just South of Canal Street in TriBeCa.

The space was a garment factory and—one Saturday morning—my mom, dad and I headed out from the ass end of Brooklyn to TriBeCa so my mom could look for work.

We all took the train out of Brighton Beach. I was grey and overcast and—since it was a weekend morning—the subway was pretty dead and desolate. The train car itself was one of those rickety old metal cars that was kinda corrugated on the side; most likely still had the old “TA” (Transit Authority) logo on the side. And—like every subway trip for me—the trip was fun. I really liked looking out the windows of subway as it trudged through Brooklyn. Especially the window at the front of the first car; looking out and holding onto the door handle of the first car felt like I was actually driving the train as it sped along.

As the train rolled along, I’d get excited when I saw glimmers of what looked like toys, balls and related cool junk on the tracks. I even had daydreams of rushing off at a nearby stop and running onto the subway tracks and to score some free cool stuff.

But that was not to be. First, I was too young and would get hit by a train and die—or at least loose a limb—if I did something like that. Second, we needed to head into Manhattan to see if my mom could get a job in a schmatta factory.

My dad was essentially laid off due to disability from having a heart attack in 1975. And he wasn’t in the Union long enough to actually around like hawks because this was the classic gritty NYC of the 1970s. Abe Beame’s shithole. The city I grew up in. A genuinely dangerous place.

But I looked around and soaked in what I could. Like Dave’s Luncheonette on the corner. It looked so fancy and cool. But we never stopped in. We just swung onto Broadway and walked a few blocks down, up some dingy staircase and only the darkened—but still lit—factory floor. Light streamed in from whatever windows were still there.

I remember seeing rows upon rows of sewing machines. Nobody seemed to be there yet we walked in as if it were no issue.

My dad shouted “Hello!” and it echoed throughout the floor. We all heard some shuffling from the back and a person appeared at the very end of the factory floor and asked “What?”

My mom and dad looked at each other and looked at me and told me to stay up front. I nodded a “Yes…” and with that they walked to the back of the factory where that guy was.

I meandered around up front, not wandering too far out of sight of my parents, but not really standing still either. I peered around and peeked around to see what I could see. I was a kid so I was looking for some cool stuff to shove in my pocket, but all I saw were miscellaneous things like screws, nails, sewing machine needs and old-school cans of oil. Nothing worth much of anything to me.

I heard looked back down the aisle to my parents talking to the factory guy. I could hear them speak to him in Yiddish and saw lots of gesticulation. Hand motions and such. The discussion was passionate but not crazy or angry. Clearly some kind of negotiation.

After a while my mom and dad came up front and the guy followed. When they came up front my dad said, “Okay time to go home.” The guy looked at me, looked at my parents and just shrugged. It wasn’t a judgmental shrug, but my parents had me in their 40s and at the time of this encounter they were in their early 50s. I looked more like I should be their grandson at the time; not their son.

Pretty sure my parents dragged me along to score some sympathy points. I mean, showing off a kid as a dependent for a job is a thing.

We walked down the stairs, walked back down Broadway, looked around to see if there was any shopping—something my parents always did after one of these work/family trips—and since there wasn’t much of anything past junk stores, we headed back to the subway and headed back home.
