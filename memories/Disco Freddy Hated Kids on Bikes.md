# Disco Freddy Hated Kids on Bikes

The thing about Brighton Beach in the 1970s and 1980s was as dumpy as it was you could still have a life if you had not much. Which meant a lot of people who might be otherwise homeless had lives as neighborhood characters.

One of those people Disco Freddy, also know as “sensational.” He kinda looked like Kramer from Seinfeld; a tall and lanky hipster doofus. But he was more tan and lean; almost middle eastern looking. And on his own you wouldn’t really consider him too much of a character. But most people only knew him from his amazing feats of strength and agility such as jumping over small paper bags and radios on the boardwalk.

Seriously.

The way pretty much everyone knew him was when he hung out on  the boardwalk between Brighton 2nd Street and Brighton 4th Street and put on his facacta show. I mean that might sound harsh, but he would basically work up the crowd with his banter, rock back and forth, do some false starts and then… Finally… He would take a daring leap over his radio or a small bag of whatever. Sometimes we’d actually see him just walking down the street listening to his radio and dancing a bit. But this two-bit act was the way most of us remembered him.

There would always be a small circle of people gathered around and watching him. Mostly adults, the elderly and their caretakers and the occasional kid. Disco Freddy was okay with kids… Unless they rode bikes. Then he’d flip out like an angry dog and chase any kid on a bike down the boardwalk. Sometimes he’d even throw bottles at the kids.

He also had this little fat high functioning guy who was always listening to his radio hang out and watch his act. When Disco Freddy was done, him and his little fat friend would walk back home to wherever they lived or hung out.
