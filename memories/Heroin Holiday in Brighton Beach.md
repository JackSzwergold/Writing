# Heroin Holiday in Brighton Beach

I wasn’t at rock bottom but I sure wasn’t at the top either. I had moved back to NYC in the fall 2000 with the wacky weekly newspaper, and my ass was unceremoniously canned in early 2001. The creative editor and co-owner of the place was shut out by the midwestern sub shop king and I was culled because I was apparently difficult to work with.

The real cause was just a power play to align editorial with business. The wacky weekly newspaper only became famous because of their content, not their ability to sell sub, pizza and beer shop ads. The final straw/excuse in my case was me telling the boss to go eff himself when he demanded I pull down the media kit I posted that was more aligned towards editorial concerns and not his. Which at the time was somehow attempting to get escort and porn ads on the site to make money.

Mind you we just cut deals with a few major movies studios and part of the reason they moved to New York was to take advantage of that synergy to grow the brand. Despite all of that, the sub shop king of Milwaukee was always looking for ways to sell the brand short.

Anyway I was canned and essentially blacklisted. I couldn’t get a basic reference from the wacky weekly newspaper to save my life and I was desperate. They wanted to destroy me.

Happily I got a job at a fancy design and home decor magazine. I really didn’t like much of their content, but they were a decent place to work because despite their implied snootiness, the people I worked with were relatively down to earth. Yeah, some treated me as a bumpkin, but it was a job and they paid and it was freelance so it sucked but I needed the job because without one I could not survive in New York.

Once Christmas, their quirky and eccentric owner invited me to a holiday party at their upper east side home. It was exciting and nerve wracking. Exciting because it meant I was accepted in some way to the group, and nerve wracking because I wasn’t rich or entitled.

Long story short, I finally had time to meet and talk with some of the staffers I only really knew via email and it felt good. I told one person I grew up in Brooklyn and when they asked “Where?” I said “Brighton Beach” and they gasped. They were thrilled I grew up there and was not asking me if I wa Russian which was a relief. They waved at friend over and then this happened.

Guy comes over and hear’s I’m from Brighton Beach and tells me how much fun he and some friends had there. I nodded politely and asked what they did. Without hesitation he told me him and his friends took a long weekend off, rented an apartment and just did heroin all weekend. I looked him up and down; he didn’t look like any of the neighborhood junkies. He looked downright suburban. He described how nice the landlord was and how great the neighborhood food was.

Then the appetizers showed up. He was excited. His friend who I worked with said how it was easy to fill up at parties.

The apartment was filled with model boats. I excused myself and talked to my boss and others about the boats.

Soon we all left. A few co-workers talked about going to see Spider-Man. They qualified it all by saying it was a stupid superhero film but they heard it was good. When we hit Park Avenue I split off and headed to the 6 train to head home.
