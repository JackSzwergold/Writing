## The Time I Shoplifted Matchbox Cars from a Te-Amo Newsstand
### About the Time I Shoplifted Some Matchbox Cars from a Local Te-Amo Newsstand

**Quick Notes**: The place had new owners (Pakistani?) and were jerks. So I lifted up the plastic from a rotating display pulled out a car and put it in my pocket.

Te-Amo wasn’t the name of a store as much as it was the name of a brand of cheap Mexican cigars that as sold around various stores across New York City at the time. Part of their marketing in the city was to pay for new signs for newsstands with one stipulation: Their branding would be front and center.

So the candy store that was near Brighton 6th Street was dubbed “the Te-Amo” because there wasn’t another one in the neighborhood at the time.

The store was an old drug store that sold cards at one point and then became a newsstand at one point. I don’t recall who the original owner of the place was, but I recall them being Italian or Jewish and had thick rimmed glasses and were generally nice to kids. There was always some kind of nickel candy and generally and array of crap that would appeal to kids.

And beyond the comics, trading cards and other random crap they had for sale, they—at least to me—had one of the best selection of Matchbox cars in the neigborhood.

For $1 and some change, Matchbox cars were a decent value for kids who wanted to collect cool and sturdy stuff.

Unlike modern cars you just grab off of a rack, back then the way it worked was there would be a display of that years Matchbox cars and each had a number connected to them.

You wanted a car, you just had to look over the rack, tell the guy behind the counter what number you wanted, handed over that dollar and change and et voila, you got a literal small matchbox-sized box that had your car in it.
