## The Time I Shoplifted Matchbox Cars from a Te-Amo Newsstand
### About the Time I Shoplifted Some Matchbox Cars from a Local Te-Amo Newsstand

We all called the store “the Te-Amo” but it was basically a junky—but beloved—neighborhood newsstand.

Te-Amo wasn’t the name of the store as much as it was the name of a brand of cheap Mexican cigars that as sold around various stores across New York City at the time. Part of their marketing in the city in the 1970s was to pay for new signs for newsstands with one stipulation: Their branding would be front and center.

So the candy store that was near Brighton 6th Street was dubbed “the Te-Amo” because there wasn’t another one in the neighborhood at the time.

In 1978, the store was an old drug store that sold cards at one point and then became a newsstand at one point. I don’t recall who the original owner of the place was, but I recall them being Italian or Jewish and had thick rimmed glasses and were generally nice to kids. There was always some kind of nickel candy and generally and array of crap that would appeal to kids.

And beyond the comics, trading cards and other random crap they had for sale, they—at least to me—had one of the best selection of Matchbox cars in the neighborhood.

For $1 and some change, Matchbox cars were a decent value for kids who wanted to collect cool and sturdy stuff.

Unlike modern cars you just grab off of a rack, back then the way it worked was there would be a display of that years Matchbox cars and each had a number connected to them.

You wanted a car, you just had to look over the rack, tell the guy behind the counter what number you wanted, handed over that dollar and change and et voila, you got a literal small matchbox-sized box that had your car in it.

I really liked buying Matchbox cars from this store since the guy was nice and always had a decent stock of Matchbox cars. And since it was around the corner from elementary school, I could window-shop each day when I headed home from school and would wait for Friday—and my allowance—to happen.

One day when I was headed to school, I noticed something weird. The newspapers in front of the store weren’t exactly organized. They seemed kinda messy compared to what they once looked like. Quickly looking into the window of the store I didn’t see the original owners, but some new guys who looked Indian or Pakistani. Never mind, I had to head to school so I would investigate later on.

And later on when I headed into the store, it was clear they had new owners: Things inside were slightly messier than they were before and the guy behind the counter shouted “What do you want?” and “Buy something or leave!” to any kid that was meandering in the shop.

I headed out and headed home; the place didn’t feel nice anymore.

A week or so passed and I—for whatever—hadn’t headed into that Te-Amo for a while so I decided to head inside.

It was a nice-ish fall day and I had a few dollars in my pocket from my allowance and felt like buying a Matchbox car.

I looked over the selection and spotted car number 21: A Renault 5TL! I liked practical little cars like that so I asked the guy for car number 21.

The guy looked confused and turned to his co-worker who rummaged through some boxes on a shelf and handled me a number 21 box… But this was not a Renault 5TL, it was some oddball construction vehicle Matchbox dubbed a “Rod Roller.” I didn’t want it and passed it back to the guy.

“I want number 21!” I said.

“This is number 21!” the guy behind the counter responded.

“No it isn’t!” I said and then pointed out hat was number 21 in the display.

Some old coot hanging out near the Lottery tickets heckled me and said, “Maybe the kid wants to the ‘21 Club!’” and poked his old coot finger near my face.

I waved his hand away and walked to the display and pointed out the car at number 21 in the display wasn’t the same car he gave me. The guy behind the counter and his partner looked at the display, noticed the difference, spoke something to each other in a language I didn’t understand and then said, “Sorry, we don’t have it.”

Dejected I asked if I could buy the car in the display to which one of them said, “No!” and then grabbed the car out of the display to shove into the storage area behind the counter.

I left the place pissed off and unhappy. The new owners had no idea what they were selling and they were treating me—an 11 year old kid—like some kinda putz.

I told my dad what happened and he went out with me the next day to see if he could get them to sell me that Renault 5TL. No luck. To make things even worse the guys behind the counter said that all I was doing was making problems so they wouldn’t sell the car to me.

Me and my dad left the place and my dad said that they were acting crazy. “Why don’t they want to sell it to you? The money is the same!” my dad said as we walked back down the avenue.

The next week or so I basically boycotted the store and didn’t give them the pleasure of getting the 5 to 25 cents per day I might spend on them for candy and trading cards.

Then one day I peeked in and saw they had rearranged things and had a new Matchbox car display on a rotating carousel away from the front counter.

Curious, I went in to investigate. The display rack was nice and new, but the cars were displayed in some kind of haphazard mix. I could tell some cars were in the wrong slots because their numbers didn’t match what I remembered as being their proper numbers in the catalog.

Still, they had some cool stuff that I wanted and as I slowly rotated the display I noticed that the plastic at the bottom could be lifted up. I played around with it with my finger, slowly looked up front and then quickly popped it up, grabbed a car and dropped it into my jacket pocket.

My heart was racing at a mile a minute and my palms were sweaty, but I slowly walked towards the entrance to the store.

“Hey!” the guy behind the counter shouted, “What do you want!” he added. I shrugged, walked out the front door and ran down the block.

Once I crossed the street I looked behind me and started to calm down a bit when I didn’t see the store owner chasing me down the block.

I walked a few more blocks and then pulled the car out of my pocket and looked it over a bit. I gotta admit I don’t remember exactly what model I snagged that day, but I was happy to snag it.

It wasn’t the car as much as the principal: These new owners didn’t treat neighborhood kids as being any better than thieves, so why not steal then?
