## A High Functioning Comedy Genius Enjoys the Bacchanal

By Jack Szwergold

The party was weird because it was fun. It was honestly the first real house party I had been too in Madison that wasn’t at the Paper Towel Museum. It was also weird because Rob—our newspaper’s editor—actually showed up and was actually drinking.

I wandered about and checked out the scene. The ground floor was like every other party: Keg, tons of people and some crappy piles of snacks on a table. I grabbed a red cup, some pretzels and walked downstairs.

Downstairs was some shitty noise DJ situation. Lots of black lights, flickering lights and in the corner—near what seemed to be the entrance to a laundry room—was DJ DangerBear or MouseHead or some bullshit like this. There he was tweaking on mixers to a room of nobody. Well, not technically nobody: I was there and so was a fellow staffer at the newspaper, Todd.

Todd was dressed up in some improvised outfit that consisted of some kind of crappy ape costume; unzipped front and no ape head. Just his sweaty long-haired head.

“Isn’t this great!” he said while bobbing out of sync with the electronic skronk playing through the sound system. I turned around and saw some people come downstairs, look around and then head back upstairs.

Todd and I were DJ WhatTheFucks’ only audience at that moment. “I can’t believe they got him!” he said, bobbing some more and taking some drags off of the cigarette in his driving glove covered hand.

I nodded politely and then headed back upstairs.

It was a bit more crowded, but not that bad. Spotted Rob and he was drunk. Which was amazing because I really can’t recall ever seeing Rob be drunk or even drinking before this party.

“Jack!” he said.

“Rob!” I responded as he placed a hand on my shoulder, leaned in and said, “I’m drunk.”

“Okay,” I said as I stood there.

The pregnant, awkward pause went on longer than expected so I said, “Hey! Let’s go upstairs.” And with that we went ahead and headed upstairs.

Make no mistake, this wasn’t a romantic invitation by a long shot. I just needed a change of pace and needed to see what was happening on the 2nd floor of this house.

The second floor was pretty chill. Kind of like the scene on the first floor but with more seating and better lighting.

That said, while there was a huge room with a lot of open space, there wasn’t a lot of room to sit. So Rob and I sat out in a hallway near the bathroom.

He was a quiet drunk for the most part, but did blurt out “She’s got a nice tushy!” when some woman with a nice ass walked by us to wait in line to get to the bathroom. “Yup!” I said in agreement.

After a while, I felt the need to not be near Rob, so I stood up and headed to the main room on the 2nd floor.

As I walked in I spotted Todd again, standing around and endlessly yammering about how great DJ WhoGivesAShit was. I walked over and said hi, and he immediately dragged me into the conversation, “Wasn’t DJ WhoCares great?” he asked me to which I nodded and shrugged and that was that.

“Cool,” the person he was talking to said and then followed up by saying, “Hey! There’s Anne!”

I had no idea who this “Anne” was but turned around and saw Anne herself. She looked like an indie/punk/D.I.Y. version of Velma from *Scooby Doo*.

She walked over and said “Hey!” to us all. But was a bit stiff. I soon found out she was a zinester; meaning she put out a zine. And in this case the zine was called something like “Baby Food” so her hipster name was “Baby Food Anne.”

We chatted for a bit and then I noticed something magical: Two people had gotten up from two chairs. So I went in sat down in one of them.

The chairs were simple, old school living room chairs. Kinda like what Archie and Edith sat in on *All in the Family*. Todd didn’t sit down, but Rob—who somehow wandered into the room—did and we had an odd mumbling conversation.

I mainly nodded at him and laughed a bit, but had no clue what his mumbling drunk mouth was talking about.

As time passed, I turned around and saw Anne standing there… But she was acting weird. She was clearly still conscious but was catatonic and staring out into nowhere.

I stood up and stood right in front of her and she barely moved. Her head and eyes twitched a bit but in general seemed to stand there like stiff, malfunctioning robot.

Someone who knew her came by, and explained to me casually that she fell into catatonic states like this all the time and it was no big deal. I nodded at them and then looked at Anne and just accepted it as is.

Just as I was about to walk away, Todd showed up and said, “What’s up?” I pointed to Anne and said, “Look at her. She’s fucked up.”

Todd looked and then just said, “So what? It’s no big deal,” pushed past me and grabbed Anne from behind her head and just kissed her. I was close enough to see what he was doing was the equivalent of kissing a statue. Her lips barely moved and wherever she was at the moment it definitely was not there.

He pulled his head away and said, “It’s no big deal,” put down his drink on a small side table in-between the two chairs and then went back to kissing her. But this time his right hand was headed straight down the front of her jeans.

I took a few steps back and didn’t know what to do. Or if doing anything would have mattered at this point. I looked at Rob, saw the chair I was sitting in was still empty and just sat down.

It was about 2:00am and I was ready to go. But still couldn’t pull myself out of the chair. So I sat and looked out the 2nd floor windows and waited for a bit before standing up, heading downstairs and walking back to my place.
