## A High Functioning Comedy Genius Enjoys the Bacchanal

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: Long time writer for a famous comedy publication. Was at a house party with him. This gal was a bit catatonic. Not passed out but standing still and like a statue. Took something. Maybe ketamine? So anyway, she’s standing there, see T.H. and point her out. He basically just says, “She gets like that…” and then grabs her and kisses her. Like kissing a mannequin. He moves away from her and some other woman comes over, shoves her hand down her pants and makes out with her. She’s still stiff like a mannequin. Part of me thinks they knew her and she was cool with being treated like this during the “bacchanal” of the party. But it felt wrong. Never saw her again.
