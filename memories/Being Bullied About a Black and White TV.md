## Being Bullied About a Black and White TV
### About the Time I Was Bullied in Elementary School for My Family Only Having a Black and White TV

By Jack Szwergold

I was a new kid at P.S. 253 and people didn’t know what to make of me. Teachers, students… I was always treated as a little bit odd when I showed up.

While you can never know what makes someone tick—or why people judge you in a certain way—a few different factors came into play: One was that I was kicked out of P.S. 100 after 2nd grade when my parents dared to complain when I was literally thrown by my ear into a coat closet by a teacher who was angry I was running around and playing with another kid. Other kids at P.S. 253 didn’t know those specifics… But they did know that some kid being transferred from one school to another was “weird” so I was treated as such.

It also didn’t help it that my parents were in their 50s at the time and technically looked like my grandparents to some. Nor did it help that I was the first American child of immigrants which made me naturally awkward and foreign to some despite my relatively fluent English at 8 years old.

It also didn’t help when teachers did the roll call each day in class and would always shout “Yakov!” instead of Jack because that technically was—and is—my legal name. Children—and some teachers—back in the day weren’t exactly open minded towards kids with “weird” non-American names or kids named “Jack” who were not actually a John.

Anyway, I was a new kid at P.S. 253 and humbly eating lunch in the cafeteria with the handful of new friends I had at time time.

As I’m sitting there eating my salami sandwich with a can of Mott’s apple juice—and a side of Hydrox cookies—I noticed this other kid, Bruce Becker, looking straight at me. I turned away and pretended to ignore him, but then he straddled up on the seat next to me and poked a finger in my shoulder.

“Hey, Jack…” he said, “Can I have a cookie?” he asked.

I looked at my four Hydrox cookies and said, “Yeah, sure…” and gave him one of them.

“Thanks…” he said as he pried the cookie open to lick the insides. Other kids started to look at what was happening when Bruce suddenly said, “Hydrox? Ha! Ha! Your family can’t even afford Oreos!” he said loud enough for all to hear.

I didn’t know what to say. I liked Hydrox cookies but I had no response to his reaction so I let it pass and kept on eating. I looked around and saw other kids staring at me. Was I about to get into a fight over cookies? Who knows.

I kept on eating.

“Hey…” said Bruce as he poked me in the shoulder again. “I hear your family only has a black and white TV?” He asked and as I was just about to say something, someone walked by and said, “What are you bugging him about? Your dad had to sell your TV! You don’t even have one!”

Bruce’s face turned pale and his expression turned dour as he turned to look at the kid who just said that. His cheeks reddened up and his lips started to quiver and—before anyone knew it—he started to cry.

“Shut up!” Bruce blurted as he cried tears and snot while gasping for air. “He’s gonna get it back by the end of the week when he gets paid!” He shouted to the kid as he walked away.

He hunched his body over and turned back to the table as he cried with his face turned down to the floor so nobody could see. I turned and poked him in the shoulder and gave him another cookie. Without a word he took the cookie and slowly ate it in between sobs and coughs. After a while stood up and walked away.
