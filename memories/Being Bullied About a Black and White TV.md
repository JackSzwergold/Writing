## Being Bullied About a Black and White TV
### About the Time I Was Bullied in Elementary School for My Family Only Having a Black and White TV

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: The time Bruce Becker tried to bully me in 3rd grade at P.S. 253 by sitting next to me in the school cafeteria and say, “I hear your family only has a black and white TV.” Then without missing a beat someone walks by and says, “What are you bugging him about? You dad had to sell your TV! You don't even have one!” He started to cry immediately and responded “Shut up! He’s gonna get it back by the end of the week when he gets paid!” Gets up and walks away.
