## Being Bullied About a Black and White TV
### About the Time I Was Bullied in Elementary School for My Family Only Having a Black and White TV

By Jack Szwergold

I was a new kid at P.S. 253 and people didn’t know what to make of me. Teachers, students… I was always treated as a little bit odd when I showed up.

While you can never know what makes someone tick—or why people judge you in a certain way—a few different factors came into play: One was that I was kicked out of P.S. 100 after 2nd grade when my parents dared to complain when I was literally thrown by my ear into a coat closet by a teacher who was angry I was running around and playing with another kid. Other kids at P.S. 253 didn’t know those specifics… But they did know that some kid being transferred from one school to another was “weird” so I was treated as such.

It also didn’t help it that my parents were in their 50s at the time and technically looked like my grandparents to some. Nor did it help that I was the first American child of immigrants which made me naturally awkward and foreign to some despite my relatively fluent English at 8 years old.

The fact that when teachers called the roll in class they would always say “Yakov…” instead of Jack. Children—and some teachers—back in the day weren’t exactly open minded towards kids with “weird” names or kids named “Jack” who were not actually a John.

Anyway, I was a new kid at P.S. 253 and eating lunch in the cafeteria with the handful of new friends I had.

As I’m sitting there eating my salami sandwich with a can of Mott’s apple juice—with a side of Hydrox cookies—I noticed Bruce Becker looking towards me. I pretended to ignore him, but then he straddled up on the seat next to me and poked me in the shoulder.

“Hey, Jack…” he said, “Can I have a cookie?” he asked.

I looked at my four Hydrox cookies and said, “Yeah, sure…” and gave him one.

“Thanks…” he said as he pried the cookie open to lick the insides. “Ha! Ha! Your family can’t even afford Oreos!” he said loud enough for all to hear.

I let it pass but looked all around to see other kids staring at me. Was I about to get into a fight? Who knows.

“Hey…” Bruce said poking me in the shoulder again. “I hear your family only has a black and white TV.” He said and as I was about to say something, someone walked by and said, “What are you bugging him about? You dad had to sell your TV! You don't even have one!”

Bruce turned to look at the kids who just said that. His cheeks turned read and his lips started to quiver and he started to cry.

“Shut up! He’s gonna get it back by the end of the week when he gets paid!” Bruce said through the tears and snot.

His body was arched as he cried and looked down to the floor. I poked him and gave him another cookie. He took it—still hunched over—ate it in between sobs, stood up and walked away.
