## Working on the Website With a Zip Drive

By Jack Szwergold

Todd tried to make out with me in Spring 1996.

I moved to Madison, Wisconsin in the fall of 1995. By 1996 I was working on the Onion’s website. It was contentious. Scott was my boss so he and I worked on the site. But he was also filming his crappy science fiction film, “SpaceGuy.”

So he was out of the office. Some of the people in power–Rob and Mark–tried to undermine and hijack the project, I protected it. I bought my own Zip 100 drive and would bring it in and out of the office to work on stuff. I would mainly work from my dumpy apartment on West Main Street. But to upload the stuff to the publication’s website I would use my bosses computer. He had a PowerMac 7100 with a 56k modern while I still had a 14.4k modem at home. 

One day Todd was there late working on whatever he was working on and came into the production office.
