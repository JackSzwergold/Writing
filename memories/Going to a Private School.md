# Going to a Private School

**Quick Notes**: About the time, shortly after getting an Atari 400 for my Bar Mitzvah, that I complained about nobody else having an Atari computer and how I was randomly dragged to some private school (Dalton?) that my brother’s miserable wife taught in because they had Atari computers there as well as “kids my age.” Needless to say the kids were private school brats and mocked me. When I asked what games they had to play, I believe they had done version of Castle Wolfenstein they played on a TRS-80 or something. It was not fun. One girl flirted with me and that was cool.
