## The Charmed Life of a Slopie

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: Publisher of NYC-based network of websites. Bully at Columbia University. Apparently raped student at Stuyvesant High School when he was a visiting teacher. Statutory rape and straight out rape. His dad is a lawyer and got him off so he has no criminal record. Also when he was younger, he shot out a pile of windows on his block with a B.B. gun and his dad apparently paid off neighbors so they wouldnâ€™t file a complaint against him.
