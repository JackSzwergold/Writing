## Being Dragged to See the King
### About the Time my Brother Got Tickets to See the King Tut Exhbit at the Met and How He Dragged Me Along

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: Being forced to see the King Tut exhibit at the Met Museum in the 1970s. Epilogue should be flashing forward to the 1990s and ripping up the Rosetta Stone program my brother’s wife’s parents gave me as a kid. Recall being rushed to go, sitting in Ben’s car hearing him yell at me about how he bought tickets and our parents didn’t care. This was 1977 and I was 9 years old.

My first memory of this event was my brother showing up on the weekend for a “suprise” visit like he usually did. To be fair, sometimes he would tell us he would show up, but this time he showed up out of nowhere.

I knew he was coming because he would buzz into the front door of the building, my dad would answer that abd then my my dad would come to the front door—that was near my room—to open it up.

“Ben is coming,” my dad would say to me in my room as he waited for Ben to come upstairs. I nodded politely, got back to doing what I doing and waited…

Ben arrived and he was very happy. He said hello to me, and then walked into the apartment and plopped himself in the living room.

That day seemed like a good visit since my brother didn’t insist on forcing himself into my room or dragging me to the living room to have “fun.” What that fun usually consisted of was simply dragging me—like some pet or toy—to the living room so he could see me and ask me horseshit questions.

This day was a good day since I was left alone in my room.

After the bustle of the initial arrival subsided, I carefully closed the door… Not completely closed since that would make it seem that I wanted to block him out, but rather partially closed with just enough opening to let sounds in and out. Just closed enough to say I wanted to be left alone, but I am giving you some leeway so you can have the illusion I am open to speaking with you.

I was 9 years old at the time and really did not want to deal with Ben who was—and is—20 years older than me.

I played, futzed and did whatever B.S. a kid does to kill time on the weekend when suddenly a fight broke out. I wasn’t too sure what it was exactly about because fights with Ben tended to never be in English; it was always in Polish, Yiddish, Hebrew or some mix of them all.

The fight was bad enough that my dad showed up at the doorway to me room and asked, “Do you want anuything to eat?” Which was his way of saying, “Do you believe this shit?” but many times he would just say, “I don’t understand what he wants!” and then walk away. This time I said, “No…” to indicate I was not hungry and when my dad stated, “I don’t understand what he wants!” I just shrugged my shoulders.

I was still 9 years old at the time.

As my dad walked away, I could hear my brother grunt and rumble and head to the bathroom. What a joy!

When my brother went to the bathroom it would usually take what professionals call “Forever” so I was free to walk around the apartment without being snagged by him in some horseshit.

I went to the living room and saw my mom staring blankly towards the TV. She saw me and asked me herself, “What does he want?” And I shrugged again. I went into the kicthen and saw my dad warming up latkes or blintzes.
