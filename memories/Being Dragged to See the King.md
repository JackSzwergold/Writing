## Being Dragged to See the King
### About the Time my Brother Got Tickets to See the King Tut Exhbit at the Met and How He Dragged Me Along

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: Being forced to see the King Tut exhibit at the Met Museum in the 1970s. Epilogue should be flashing forward to the 1990s and ripping up the Rosetta Stone program my brother’s wife’s parents gave me as a kid. Recall being rushed to go, sitting in Ben’s car hearing him yell at me about how he bought tickets and our parents didn’t care. This was 1977 and I was 9 years old.

My first memory of this event was my brother showing up on the weekend for a “suprise” visit like he usually did. To be fair, sometimes he would tell us he would show up, but this time he showed up out of nowhere.

I knew he was coming because he would buzz into the front door of the building, my dad would answer that abd then my my dad would come to the front door—that was near my room—to open it up.

“Ben is coming,” my dad would say to me in my room as he waited for Ben to come upstairs. I nodded politely, got back to doing what I doing and waited…

Ben arrived and he was very happy. He said hello to me, and then walked into the apartment and plopped himself in the living room.

That day seemed like a good visit since my brother didn’t insist on forcing himself into my room or dragging me to the living room to have “fun.” What that fun usually consisted of was simply dragging me—like some pet or toy—to the living room so he could see me and ask me horseshit questions.

This day was a good day since I was left alone in my room.

After the bustle of the initial arrival subsided, I carefully closed the door… Not completely closed since that would make it seem that I wanted to block him out, but rather partially closed with just enough opening to let sounds in and out. Just closed enough to say I wanted to be left alone, but I am giving you some leeway so you can have the illusion I am open to speaking with you.

I was 9 years old at the time and really did not want to deal with Ben who was—and is—20 years older than me.

I played, futzed and did whatever B.S. a kid does to kill time on the weekend when suddenly a fight broke out. I wasn’t too sure what it was exactly about because fights with Ben tended to never be in English; it was always in Polish, Yiddish, Hebrew or some mix of them all.

The fight was bad enough that my dad showed up at the doorway to me room and asked, “Do you want anuything to eat?” Which was his way of saying, “Do you believe this shit?” but many times he would just say, “I don’t understand what he wants!” and then walk away. This time I said, “No…” to indicate I was not hungry and when my dad stated, “I don’t understand what he wants!” I just shrugged my shoulders.

I was still 9 years old at the time.

As my dad walked away, I could hear my brother grunt and rumble and head to the bathroom. What a joy!

When my brother went to the bathroom it would usually take what professionals call “Forever” so I was free to walk around the apartment without being snagged by him in some horseshit.

I went to the living room and saw my mom staring blankly towards the TV. She saw me and asked me herself, “What does he want?” And I shrugged again. I went into the kicthen and saw my dad warming up latkes or blintzes. He turned to me and said, “Don’t worry… I’ll bring them to you…” So with that I headed back to my room and made sure the door was closed just enough and open just enough.

By the time I got back to my room I could hear the sounds of someone finishing up their business in a bathroom; it didn’t seem like a lot of time passed but maybe the stress of the moment was deceiving me.

Anyway, I am in my room and was on the floor doing whatever when my brother showed, pushed open the door without asking and then blurted out some stream of anger. Something about how much time and effort he spent getting tickets to the King Tut exhibit at the Met and how our parents did not care. Somehow I was suppposed to comiserate and “care” about this so I did what I always did: I shrugged and made some minor noises that acknowledged I went along with it.

“Come! We are going to go!” my brother said to me as if I had no choice. “Where are we going?” I asked. “To see the King Tut exhibit!” I’m not too sure what made him think I would want to see this, but in his mind bullying into doing something good was intrinsically a good thing.

He sensed a pause from me and reacted, “You know who King Tut is, right?”

I immediately said, “Yes…” despite the fact all I knew about King Tut at the time was the Steve Martin song, some vague crappy lessons from elemetary school and the fact one of the Micronaut action figures I had was named “Pharoid” which I was smart enough to know was connected to the Pharoah in Egypt.

I was 9 years old at the time.

Anyway, my brother inists on dragging me along, and my father comes out and states, “Why are you making such a big deal about this?” I go to put on my jacket to join my brother. I really didn’t want to go, but I learned from my experience at the time that it was better if I went along with Ben and his plans than say no. He was—and is—very violent, and giving him a sacrifice of some time was somewhat better than him sitting around and verbally abusing me—and his own family—for the rest of the afternoon.

“Come on!” my brother said, “Let’s go!” as he stormed out of the apartment and into the hallway. “I’ll be downstairs!” I shouted. I turned to my dad who made sure to bundle me up a bit. He gave me a kiss on the head and I said, “See ya later!”

I walked out the door and ran to the staircase with my hand in my jacket pocket holding my Micronaut in place.

As I walked out of the building and into the afternoon sunlight I saw what was a typical neighborhood day playing out: Yentas sitting in front of the building and kids playing in the street.

I saw some neighborhood kids invite me over to play, but I told them I had to go somewhere. I walked past them, into my brothers car and closed the door.

Pretty much immeiately from the moment the door closed to barely the moment my brother pulled out of the parking space I was inundated with him venting—seemingly endlessly—about our parents. I had no problem with them, but he seemed to be perpetually angry at them.

And that was on a good day. Today was anything but good.

We drove down Ocean Parkway, to the Belt Parkway, to the Gowanus Expressway, to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway to the Brooklyn Bridge. All along the way, endless negativity from my brother.

I was 9 years old at the time. He was 20 years older. And in his mind this was acceptable.

By the time we got to the Brooklyn Bridge I was relieved. The bridge had this grating for a roadway that made for an enldess hum as cars drove over. The second the wheels of my brother’s car hit the Brooklyn Bridge that hum, that white noise was beautiful… I could not hear a thing he was saying, and I smiled as we drove over the bridge and I was able to enjoy the view without the bullshit.

When we got to the Manhattan side, the hum settled, but my brother was still going at a mile a minute… His mouth was at least.

I never knew what the concept of repression—or dissociation—was back as a kid, but I did know at a certain point in dealing with the endless pile of B.S. my brother would dish out, my brain would seemingly become numb. While I knew I was physically there—wherever that “there” happened to be—my brain would be numb as if I was in a dream.

The next thing you know we are on 5th Avenue in frontb of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. I had never been to any museum past the Museum of Natural History as a kid, so this was technically my first step into a larger world of so-called “culture”… The thing is—as mentioned before—I was numb to the experience and all this place was to me was yet another building, and yet another place where my brother—in his quest to make my supposedly bad life “better”—would drag me too.

I rememeber getting out of the car as my brother went to park the car and meeting up with his wife at the time. She was a bit of a patronizing hippie feminist. She hated my brother and treated him like crap, and would insist that he drag me to cultural events she approved of in some bizarrely dysfunctional circle of codepency.

All I remember was me having to wait in line with her and her asking me tons of nonsene questions and me trying to answer them in any way to makre her seem happy. I was never happy in the scenarios.

We were approaching the front of the line as she started to complain about where my brother was when he finally showed up. He was breathless and said something to the effect of I was worried about where he was when he ran off. Never actually cared. Never understood why I need to be there for this thing. I mean if he wants to go on a date with his wife to the Met, go for it… But why was I—a kid—dragged along as if I would enjoy being a third wheel on a shitty date?

Anyway, before you knew it we were in the museum. I liked the little tin museum tag they gave me and rubbed it as we walked around.
