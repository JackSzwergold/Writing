## Being Dragged to See the King
### About the Time my Brother Got Tickets to See the King Tut Exhibit at the Met and How He Dragged Me Along

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: Being forced to see the King Tut exhibit at the Met Museum in the 1970s. Epilogue should be flashing forward to the 1990s and ripping up the Rosetta Stone program my brother’s wife’s parents gave me as a kid. Recall being rushed to go, sitting in Ben’s car hearing him yell at me about how he bought tickets and our parents didn’t care. This was 1977 and I was 9 years old.
