## The Time I Discovered a Cool Toy Store on Bleecker Street

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: About the time in the late 1970s when my sister and her abusive husband took me on a trip to Greenwich Village so they could buy custom sandals on West 4th Street. I got bored and asked to walk around the neighborhood. We walked down Jones Street and I spotted what looked like an antique toy shop but it also had a display of Japanese toys in the window. Including a wind-up R2-D2 I never saw before. My sister didn’t let me go in. I screamed about it but she insisted we had to go to her bother-in-law’s place on Jones Street. We went there. It was in a co-op building. He had a Play-Doh barber shop set and when I reached for it, he smacked my hand and pulled it away. Next thing you know they were smoking pot and laughing. I don’t know why must at some point her husband yelled at her. She sat frozen, with hands folded between her legs, head down and visibly shaking a bit. They left her like that and they just went back to smoking pot and laughing. The room was sunlit like that Carole King album cover. I sat or stood somewhere frozen; that’s the only detail I don’t remember.

I don’t remember the exact year but I know it was 1978 or 1979 and I was in Greenwich Village with my sister, her husband and her husband’s brother.

I often got dragged around on horseshit trips like this because my parents were old, and my siblings were younger and thought I would like being dragged along on their afternoon dates. Nevermind the fact that I liked playing out on the street in front of my building instead of hanging around with people in their 30s, they always seemed to figure out a way to drag me along. As if dragging me out of the home and neighborhood I loved was a “good deed” or some shit like that.

Anyway, my first memory of the trip was going to some sandal shop on West 4th Street near Jones Street. Apparently my sister’s husband wanted to get some leather sandals and my pressence sitting aorund and doing nothing was required.

I remember him and his brother were—pressumably—high and laughing and goofing around in the sandal shop while my sister and I waited.

At some point I stood up and said I was bored. And after some complaints and negotiation, my sister agreed to walk me around the block to alleviate my boredom.

I think this was the first time I was ever in Greenwich Village, and the place seemed interesting. The streets were tree-lined and nice. I didn’t see signs of the poor working class life I knew in Brooklyn, but things seemed nice and friendly.

As we walked around, at some point we hit Bleecker Street. I remember it being sun drenched and pleasant. Just as we were about to turn down to head backn to the sandal shop, I spotted what looked like a carousel horse in a store window.

“I want to go there!” I told my sister who then said, “We don’t have time! We need to go back.” And this went on for a bit until I convinced her to just let me look in the window of the shop.

So I walked over and looked in the window. It was definitely a toy store, but not like any toy store I knew. For one, the window not only had a carousel horse in it, but there were also all kinds of old toys nicely displayed in the window.

That was cute, but of no interest to my 1970s kid sensibilities. Then I saw something in the window that grabbed my attention: A huge bowl filled with what looked like wind-up R2-D2s! What the eff was that? I already had a small collection of Kenner *Star Wars* figures, but never saw a wind-up R2-D2 before. They looked similar to the Kenner figure but had a tag with Japanese text on it.

I gasped and checked my pocket for money. I had some quarter and change on me; maybe I could score a wind-up R2-D2? So I looked at my sister and
