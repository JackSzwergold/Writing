## The Time I Discovered a Cool Toy Store on Bleecker Street

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: About the time in the late 1970s when my sister and her abusive husband took me on a trip to Greenwich Village so they could buy custom sandals on West 4th Street. I got bored and asked to walk around the neighborhood. We walked down Jones Street and I spotted what looked like an antique toy shop but it also had a display of Japanese toys in the window. Including a wind-up R2-D2 I never saw before. My sister didn’t let me go in. I screamed about it but she insisted we had to go to her bother-in-law’s place on Jones Street. We went there. It was in a co-op building. He had a Play-Doh barber shop set and when I reached for it, he smacked my hand and pulled it away. Next thing you know they were smoking pot and laughing. I don’t know why must at some point her husband yelled at her. She sat frozen, with hands folded between her legs, head down and visibly shaking a bit. They left her like that and they just went back to smoking pot and laughing. The room was sunlit like that Carole King album cover. I sat or stood somewhere frozen; that’s the only detail I don’t remember.
