## The Time I Discovered a Cool Toy Store on Bleecker Street

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: About the time in the late 1970s when my sister and her abusive husband took me on a trip to Greenwich Village so they could buy custom sandals on West 4th Street. I got bored and asked to walk around the neighborhood. We walked down Jones Street and I spotted what looked like an antique toy shop but it also had a display of Japanese toys in the window. Including a wind-up R2-D2 I never saw before. My sister didn’t let me go in. I screamed about it but she insisted we had to go to her bother-in-law’s place on Jones Street. We went there. It was in a co-op building. He had a Play-Doh barber shop set and when I reached for it, he smacked my hand and pulled it away. Next thing you know they were smoking pot and laughing. I don’t know why must at some point her husband yelled at her. She sat frozen, with hands folded between her legs, head down and visibly shaking a bit. They left her like that and they just went back to smoking pot and laughing. The room was sunlit like that Carole King album cover. I sat or stood somewhere frozen; that’s the only detail I don’t remember.

I don’t remember the exact year but I know it was 1978 or 1979 and I was in Greenwich Village with my sister, her husband and her husband’s brother.

I often got dragged around on horseshit trips like this because my parents were old, and my siblings were younger and thought I would like being dragged along on their afternoon dates. Nevermind the fact that I liked playing out on the street in front of my building instead of hanging around with people in their 30s, they always seemed to figure out a way to drag me along. As if dragging me out of the home and neighborhood I loved was a “good deed” or some shit like that.

Anyway, my first memory of the trip was going to some sandal shop on West 4th Street near Jones Street. Apparently my sister’s husband wanted to get some leather sandals and my pressence sitting aorund and doing nothing was required.

I remember him and his brother were—pressumably—high and laughing and goofing around in the sandal shop while my sister and I waited.

At some point I stood up and said I was bored. And after some complaints and negotiation, my sister agreed to walk me around the block to alleviate my boredom.

I think this was the first time I was ever in Greenwich Village, and the place seemed interesting. The streets were tree-lined and nice. I didn’t see signs of the poor working class life I knew in Brooklyn, but things seemed nice and friendly.

As we walked around, at some point we hit Bleecker Street. I remember it being sun drenched and pleasant. Just as we were about to turn down to head backn to the sandal shop, I spotted what looked like a carousel horse in a store window.

“I want to go there!” I told my sister who then said, “We don’t have time! We need to go back.” And this went on for a bit until I convinced her to just let me look in the window of the shop.

So I walked over and looked in the window. It was definitely a toy store, but not like any toy store I knew. For one, the window not only had a carousel horse in it, but there were also all kinds of old toys nicely displayed in the window.

That was cute, but of no interest to my 1970s kid sensibilities. Then I saw something in the window that grabbed my attention: A huge bowl filled with what looked like wind-up R2-D2s! What the eff was that? I already had a small collection of Kenner *Star Wars* figures, but never saw a wind-up R2-D2 before. They looked similar to the Kenner figure but had a tag with Japanese text on it.

I gasped and checked my pocket for money. I had some quarter and change on me; maybe I could score a wind-up R2-D2? So I looked at my sister and asked her if we could go into the store.

“No!” she said. “We need to go back!” she added. And this went on for a little bit until I accepted the futility of the struggle, caved in and headed back to the sandal shop with her.

As we walked away I made a mental note of the cross-streets. Perhaps I could convince my dad to go to this toy store next weekend?

Anyway, after walking a short bit back to West 4th Street we were back at the sandal store. My sister’s husband was out in front waiting with his brother and instantly complaining about her being late.

“Jack saw a toy store,” she said to her husband. Her husband then looked at me and said, “No toys today.” And with that we all headed down the block to his brother’s place.

While the Village was filled old school NYC brick buildings, my sister’s husband’s brother lived in something that looked like a drab condo building on Cornellia Street. Quite possibly the ugliest building on the block.

We went inside, rode up the elevator and we in his place. Inside, his apartment seemed cool. It was filled with sun, plants and wood furniture. It kinda looked like the cover to Carole King’s “Tapestry” in its own way.

I walked inside and sat on a couch. Not much for a kid to do in this place. They gave me a glass of water and I basically sat around and stared for a bit.

After a while, my sister, her husband and his brother sat down near the coffee table. My sister’s husband started to roll up a joint and his brother talked in hushed tones as he looked at me. My sister just sat there, pretty catatonic.

At some point I spotted something to play with: A Play-Doh barbershop set! Cool! It was still in it’s box, so I walked over grabbed it and started to open the box when my sister’s husband’s brother stood up, grabbed it out of my hand and said, “No… That’s not for you.” And put it up on a table.

By then, the literaln joint was lit and my sister’s husband inhaled and then passed it onto his brother. My sister sat still and didn’t participate. This went on for a while with the two guys smoking and joking and me—being a kid—feeling trapped and my sister sitting there and doing nothing like a robot that had shut down.

At some point, my sister said something and her husband stood up and just shoved her back onto the couch and yelled at her. She sat their like a sack of rocks and just took it; head down, pigeon toed and silent.

I had no idea what to do, but I looked at the my sister’s husband and his brother and half expected them to start bullying me.

I turned and looked out the window and found some comfort in the sun and shadows cast by the plants in the window.
