## Learning How to Ride a Bike
### About the Time I Learned How to Ride A Bike on Surf Avenue

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICKNOTES**: How I learned how to ride a bike when I was a kid on Surf Avenue in the 1970s, and how my sister resented it and abused me after it happened.

I don’t know how old I was but I knew I was a kid and it was cold. Everyone was dressed up in winterish clothes. But it wasn’t winter since there was no snow on the ground and I was being taking outside to learn how to ride a bike, which would have been cruel to subject a kid to if it was actually cold.

The whole family was there… At least the whole family that lived in Brighton Beach at the time: Me, my dad, my mom and my older sister.

This was a big deal since usually at least one family memember stayed behind in the apartment to make sure things didn’t catch on fire or someone didn’t break in to steal our stuff.

My dad decided the best place to teach me how to ride a bike was the sidewalk near the one sharp curve on Surf Avenue; the area right near the handball courts on West 5th Street. It was a great choice in retrospect; it was somewhat desolate and empty and since it was a long stretch of sidewalk I had a lot of sidewalk I could putz around on before hitting a curb.

The lesson started out simply: My dad who was walking the small red bike in the street stopped, talked to my mom and then asked me to sit on the bike. I went on and sat on the bike’s yellowed—but still cool looking—glitter covered seat. Put one foot on one pedal and the other foot on another pedal.

My dad was holding the handlebars with both hands but then shuffled to the side and held the back of the banana seat with one hand and front handlebars with his other hand.

I was somewhat balanced but it was clear that without my dad there I would fall down on my side. Then my dad said, “Okay… Push the pedals…” I did, but it was awkward. With my dad holding on the bike like that it felt more like I was on a rickety merry-go-round than propelling myself down the street.

I pushed and grunted a bit, but never was able to get my own balance.

This went on and on for a while. Soon enough the whole family was involved including my mom and sister who took turns holding onto the other side of the bike as my dad continued to push and attempt to coach me along.

After a while, it became nothing but stressful. All of the rolling up and back down the street was giving me pieces—and ideas—of what I should be doing, but it was hard for me to do it with people literally hanging on so close to me and basically arguing about what to do next while I sat in the middle.

After a while, my dad called a break. We rolled the bike over to the iron fence next to a slim slice of grass, walked through a busted opening in the fence and had an impromptu picnic.

The blanket was an old brown and beige blanket my parents got as refugees, and the lunch consisted of munester cheese sandwiches, grapes and maybe a can or two of Mott’s apple juice; it was basically a larger version of the lunch I would take to school each day.

As I sat on the grass, unwrapping the wax paper from my sandwich, I tuned out my mom and dad arguing in Polish or Yiddish. You could tell there was some heated debate happening regarding the best way they could teach me how to ride a bike.

My sister sat nearby and only said some cursory, basic and almost punishing things. I nodded politely in response but not in passion; there was always an undercurrent of meanness to her interactions with me even when she acted “nice.”

I started to eat the sandwich, stared at the grass and then stared at the sky. My head was calm and clear, and when I turned to look at my bike I could feel my “ride a bike” neurons snap together: I knew how to ride a bike!

I stood up, threw the remnants of the sandwich on the blanket and ran to the bike.

“I know how to do it! I know how to do it!” I shouted as I grabbed the bike, straddled it’s seat, pushed down on the pedal and finally rode on my own.

My balance was wobbly, but with each push the feeling of balance—and what I had to do to retain it—became clearer and clearer. It was so clear I was able to ignore the fact my mom, dad and sister were frantically chasing me down Surf Avenue as I rode away from them. This one crazy feeling: I remembered riding my tricycle or Big Wheel down the block as a kid, but they could always catch up to me. But as I rode this crappy red Schwinn bike I realized I could ride a bike fast enough to get away from them! What a feeling!

Soon enough I stopped because I saw some people in front of me—who were not my family—noticing the scene and attempting to run and grab me. Instead I awkwardly turned the bike around and rode back towards my mom, dad and sister.

Instead of riding fast I pedalled a bit and coasted towards them. My dad came closer and gently grabbed the bike. The look on his face—and my mother’s—was happy and concerned. “Now you can ride a bike!” my dad said with a smile on his face as he puffed a bit harder than usual from running. My mom ran over and said, “Hey! Look at me!” which I did and then she grabbed my head and kissed me on the forehead.
