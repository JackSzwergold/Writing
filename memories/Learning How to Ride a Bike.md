## Learning How to Ride a Bike

I don’t know how old I was but I knew I was a kid and it was cold. Everyone was dressed up in winterish clothes. But it wasn’t winter since there was no snow on the ground and I was being taking outside to learn how to ride a bike, which would have been cruel to subject a kid to if it was actually cold.
