# Mr. C and Mr. E Buy Gold Chains on 6th Street

**Quick Notes**: Mr. C and Mr. E were gym teachers at Reynolds Junior High School on Neptune Avenue in Sheepshead Bay. They were assholes. They basically ran the gym class and told us this, that and the other, but they were uninspiring bureaucrats in the Board of Education whose main job was keep the kids in line. Pretty much like every no-name teacher in NYC in the 1980s.  I was at a friend’s house on Brighton 6th Street one weekend when his little brother spotted the both of them down the block. They were talking to the fat bookie on the corner near Brighton Beach Avenue. The bookie worked out of a weird, small storefront that was once a candy shop or newsstand but was now his personal club and “car service”; meaning a “legit” car service that delivered hookers and drugs to whoever.

Anyway, my friend’s brother shouted at us to look out the window and we looked out and saw Mr. E and Mr. C talking to the fat bookie. They were looking at gold chains, exchanged money and took off.

We knew these teachers were shit, but this was proof.
