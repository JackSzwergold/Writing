## That Computer Was the Worst Gift Ever
### About How I Was Given an Atari 400 “Computer” for My Bar Mitzvah and it Was One of the Most Dysfunctional Gifts Ever Given to Me in My Life

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: Describe getting an Atari 400 for my Bar Mitzvah. Worst gift ever. Berated by Ben and Karen for playing games instead of programming them on this piece of shit “computer.”

***

It was 1980. I was 12 years old. Just headed to Junior High School and boy, was I obsessed with videogames. *Space Invaders*, *GORF* and *Bite Monster* were my favorites because they were the only games I had access to in crappy Brighton Beach.

Never heard of *Bite Monster*? Don’t worry… Most people didn’t. *Bite Monster* was the name of some German *Pac-Man* bootleg the local candy store—“40 Thieves”—had. I really liked playing *Bite-Monster*.

Anway, I was really into videogames at the time. I loved going to the arcades in Coney Island and playing some of the old school pinball and electromagnetic games they still had there: Horse racing, target shooting, baseball… But as much fun as they were, they were inherently limited by physical space.

The playing field on an electromagnetic game was just what you saw in front of you. Oh, sometimes it was cool and fun in it’s own kitschy way, but each game only had limited, physical real world appeal.

A videogame—on the other hand—was potentially limitless. A grid of pixels on the screen flashed and could recreate tons of different worlds, fantasies and realms.

One could not play *Pac-Man* in another medium.

Anyway, I loved videogames and I longed to have a video game system at home. And at the time the premier video game system was the classic Atari 2600. Clunky graphics aside, Atari games were fun since—while they might have not had the graphics and details of their arcade counterparts—they were far and away more interesting to play and look at than some of the TV game systems at the time that let you play games such as skeet shoot or crappy shooting gallery.

Anyway, in 1980 I was 12 years old going on 13 and for a Jewish kid that meant a Bar Mitzvah. I was never religious, but went to Hebrew school at the time and learned the most important thing a Jewish kid could learn about the occassion: Relatives will come out of nowhere to toss tons of cash and expensive gifts at you.

I was a dellusional kid at the time. Despite the fact my parents were poor and my extended family treated my family—and me—like utter shit, I had some great fantasy that somehow on this wonderful day, all differences would be put aside. Someho respect and love would be finally be bestowed on me and my family by that time honored tradition of giving somebody and expensive gift or piles of cash.

So as the date approached I started to flip through the Sunday newspaper advertisements with intent and purpose: May’s, Topp’s, Macy’s, A&S and Korvette’s… Which of these low-brow to mid-brow discount chains would give me the best deal—and most convincing economic argument—that I could use to persude the adults in my life to toss their well intentioned Bar Mitzvah cash towards so I could finally play videogames at home.

One Saturday night, after my dad picked up the Sunday Daily News, I picked through the non-news detritus on the living room table. There between the Parade Magazine and the Sunday comics was a sight to be seen: Two dinosaurs fighting each other on the cover of the Radio Shack supplement.

I held onto thet supplement with intent and soaked in all the details: The game was called xxx and if I wanted to play it I needed to own a TRS-80 color computer. Just those words, “Color Computer” screamed humblebrag to me: “Other computers might be computers, but this computer was in full color!”

The idea of such a thing boggled my mind. And better yet… There was a Radio Shack right nearby us in the Trump Village shopping center. I imagined myself wandering those aisles and getting the inside skinny on hot new TRS-80 games before anybody else knew.

I took the Radio Shack supplement and carefully stored it in my desk drawer and would pull it out once in a while.

One weekend, as I was daydreaming on the floor of my room—toys, comics and that supplement near me—my brother showed up.

He acted odd… Almost strange… There was no shouting or fighting as he walked into my room, kneeled down and started to talk to me.

“What are you reading?” he asked.

I showed him what I was reading: It was the Radio Shack supplement with the two dinosaurs fighting on it.

“Do you want to play this game?” he asked.

I nodded, “Yes…” as I started to explain what the game was and what a Radio Shack TRS-80 computer was.

“That’s very nice,” he said. “Maybe you can get that for your Bar Mitzvah!” he added.

I nodded, but was confused. While my brother wasn’t mean all the time, the kind of “nice” he was now was somewhat creepy. His tone of voice sounded a bit off as well; as if he was forcing himself to be nice.

But I accepted it for what it was worth.

A few months later—in June—my Bar Miztvah came and it happened and that is the absolute best that can be said about. My family wasn’t religious so the actual event was cursory rather than anything spectacular; in retrospect it should have never have happened and perhaps a basic birthday party with some pizza and ice cream would have been more honest.

After the somewhat awkward ceremony, we ended up at back at the family home on Ocean Parkway. I saw boxes on the table in the living room and as ready to go at them.

So after accepting cards from relatives and kisses on the cheek, I started to rip things open. Soon enough I saw the word “Atari” on a silver box. I renoved more wrapping and saw it right in front of me: “Atari 400 Personal Computer.” What?

As I looked around the box, some relatives gasped and started to gab and my brother focused on explaining what the computer was.

“This is better than a video game system!” he said. “You can make your own games!” he added.

I wasn’t exactly dejected; I mean programming your own games is fine but I guess I need to play some games to begin with.

“Are there any games?” I bluntly asked, and then and there my brother revealed a small pile of software. “Star Raiders” and “Life” and an audio cassette that said “Space Invaders” on it. I didn’t understand how that tape worked so my brother showed me.

He took the cassette tape, stuck it into an odd looking tape deck that sat next to the computer and loaded it. For seemingly an eternity there was a blank blue screen on the TV set with the steady drone of a beep coming through a speaker.

Soon enough the words “Space Invaders” showed up on the screen. But what I was looking at did not look like the “Space Invaders” I remembered from “40 Thieves” looked like. I grabbed. joystick and played. It was fun, but different.

Next up was *Star Raiders* which was something else. It was a first person start fighter simulator and while it took some reading to understand how it worked, it was a funm game.

“And you know, when we finally get you the BASIC cartridge, you can make your own games,” my brother said.

I played these games and enjoyed them, but something feeled wrong. While I technically enjoyed the games, it still felt weird I would own something like this.

At that age I didn’t want a computer. I just wanted to play videogames. Who else in my neighborhood had a computer?

Weeks would pass and slowly some of my friends would end up getting computers. In retrospect, Atari was making a big “educational” push so these so-called “computers” were being marketed as a smarter alternative to video games to people. And some of those people were friends of mine.

One of the worst things about having a computer like that in the 1980s is very few stores sold software or hardware for them. I was lucky since the same Atari joysticks they used on the Atari 2600 could be used on an Atari 400—which meant I could buy replacements at local toy stores—but that was about it.

Anyway, friends if mine told me about stores in “The City” (aka: Manhattan) that sold software for Atari computers and I was excited. They told me about all kinds of cool games and stuff that were up for grabs and I wanted to check them out. So they gave me the address of one of the stores and my dad and I planned on visiting the shop.

The place was near the Empire State Building and called “The Computer Center.” The shop was small, but neat and had all kinds of different home computers on display… Including the Atari 400 and Atari 800.

Racks were filled with zip-lock backs filled with software on cassette and disk. I didn’t know what many of these games were, but I was happy to browse and see what was out there.

One game caught my eye: It was called “Baja Buggy.” It basically was an independently made clone of the Atari arcade game “Pole Position.” You drove a dirt buggy in somewhat first person point of view through a desert in some kind of race.

I wanted it, but it cost $29.99. Which was waaay out of the price-range of my allowance.
