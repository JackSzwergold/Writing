## That Computer Was the Worst Gift Ever
### About How I Was Given an Atari 400 “Computer” for My Bar Mitzvah and it Was One of the Most Dysfunctional Gifts Ever Given to Me in My Life

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: Describe getting an Atari 400 for my Bar Mitzvah. Worst gift ever. Berated by Ben and Karen for playing games instead of programming them on this piece of shit “computer.”

It was 1980. I was 12 years old. Just headed to Junior High School and boy, was I obsessed with videogames. *Space Invaders*, *GORF* and *Bite Monster* were my favorites because they were the only games I had access to in crappy Brighton Beach.

Never heard of *Bite Monster*? Don’t worry… Most people didn’t. *Bite Monster* was the name of some German *Pac-Man* bootleg the local candy store—“40 Thieves”—had. I really liked playing *Bite-Monster*.

Anway, I was really into videogames at the time. I loved going to the arcades in Coney Island and playing some of the old school pinball and electromagnetic games they still had there: Horse racing, target shooting, baseball… But as much fun as they were, they were inherently limited by physical space.

The playing field on an electromagnetic game was just what you saw in front of you. Oh, sometimes it was cool and fun in it’s own kitschy way, but each game only had limited, physical real world appeal.

A videogame—on the other hand—was potentially limitless. A grid of pixels on the screen flashed and could recreate tons of different worlds, fantasies and realms.

One could not play *Pac-Man* in another medium.

Anyway, I loved videogames and I longed to have a video game system at home. And at the time the premier video game system was the classic Atari 2600. Clunky graphics aside, Atari games were fun since—while they might have not had the graphics and details of their arcade counterparts—they were far and away more interesting to play and look at than some of the TV game systems at the time that let you play games such as skeet shoot or crappy shooting gallery.

Anyway, in 1980 I was 12 years old going on 13 and for a Jewish kid that meant a Bar Mitzvah. I was never religious, but went to Hebrew school at the time and learned the most important thing a Jewish kid could learn about the occassion: Relatives will come out of nowhere to toss tons of cash and expensive gifts at you.

I was a dellusional kid at the time. Despite the fact my parents were poor and my extended family treated my family—and me—like utter shit, I had some great fantasy that somehow on this wonderful day, all differences would be put aside. Someho respect and love would be finally be bestowed on me and my family by that time honored tradition of giving somebody and expensive gift or piles of cash.

So as the date approached I started to flip through the Sunday newspaper advertisements with intent and purpose: May’s, Topp’s, Macy’s, A&S and Korvette’s… Which of these low-brow to mid-brow discount chains would give me the best deal—and most convincing economic argument—that I could use to persude the adults in my life to toss their well intentioned Bar Mitzvah cash towards so I could finally play videogames at home.

One Saturday night, after my dad picked up the Sunday Daily News, I picked through the non-news detritus on the living room table. There between the Parade Magazine and the Sunday comics was a sight to be seen: Two dinosaurs fighting each other on the cover of the Radio Shack supplement.

I held onto thet supplement with intent and soaked in all the details: The game was called xxx and if I wanted to play it I needed to own a TRS-80 color computer. Just those words, “Color Computer” screamed humblebrag to me: “Other computers might be computers, but this computer was in full color!”

The idea of such a thing boggled my mind. And better yet… There was a Radio Shack right nearby us in the Trump Village shopping center. I imagined myself wandering those aisles and getting the inside skinny on hot new TRS-80 games before anybody else knew.

I took the Radio Shack supplement and carefully stored it in my desk drawer and would pull it out once in a while.

One weekend, as I was daydreaming on the floor of my room—toys, comics and that supplement near me—my brother showed up.
