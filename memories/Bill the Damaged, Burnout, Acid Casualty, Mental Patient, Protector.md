## Bill the Damaged, Burnout, Acid Casualty, Mental Patient, Protector: About a Neighborhood Burnout Who Protected Children

By Jack Szwergold

I have no idea where Bill came from, but one spring in the 1970s he just showed up and hung out on our Ocean Parkway block seemingly every day. He was this white guy who wore a denim jacket with a red haired, frizzy Jewfro and he would just stand out there with a thousand yard stare and a frozen smile on his face. What was he smiling at or about? Who knew! He just stood, smiled and started vacantly just like a real life caricature of hippie burnout you would see in an underground comic book at a head shop or hippie store.

At first us neighborhood kids thought he was creepy. He was definitely damaged. Maybe he was a burnout? Or an acid casualty? Or a mental patient? Or all of the above? Brighton Beach was filled with all kinds of wacky characters in the 1970s and and with Coney Island Hospital a few blocks away any of those explanations would make sense. But after a while, we realized he was just weird but harmless. 

All of the old yentas in front of the building noticed him and checked him out each day, but nobody said anything to him. They checked out everyone  every day and silently judged them. I guess someone like Bill would have had to grab one of us kids and pulled a knife out for at least one of the yentas to maybe say something like, “Oh! Did you see that? That’s dreadful? Someone should do something.” But for now, nobody said nothing to him or about him. Except for my mom.

My mom noticed him when she was coming home from work or shopping or whatever one day. She came up to him—not fearful of him or judgmental of what his intentions were—and just started to talk to him pretty casually. What did she talk to him about? Who knows. I was a just kid. But I did remember she was smiling at him, made some hand motion—or said something—about coming back and then walked away. We kept on playing, Bill kept on staring and then like 10 or 15 minutes later my mom is back. This time carrying a small sandwich wrapped in wax paper; just like the sandwiches she and my dad made for school lunch.

Bill smiled, took the sandwich, thanked her, unwrapped the sandwich and starting eating it standing in the same spot he always stood in. My mom walked away and joined the other yentas in talking about whatever they talked about. Pretty sure the sandwich she gave him was a muenster cheese sandwich on white bread because I didn’t see anything dark in between the slices like peanut butter, jelly or salami in there. Whatever the sandwich was, Bill clearly liked it because he would just stand there, smile and eat the sandwich.

This kind of sandwich ritual became a new thing for my mom and Bill and us kids. We would be playing outside, my mom would come down and give Bill a simple sandwich and life would go on. One day Bill even spoke when I came near him—something I never heard him do before—and simply said to me, “Your mom is nice!” And just stared and kept on eating the sandwich as us kids played. But that wasn’t the last time we’d hear him say something.

Sometimes older kids in the neighborhood would come by to harass and bully the younger kids. But their efforts only went so far with Bill standing there. When they came by he would suddenly shout, “Get away from them!” but he did it so frantically it’s like each word overlapped the other into one big blurted bark of “GETAWAYFROMTHEM!” When he frantically shouted like this, he would visibly shake a bit and his face would get red. And within seconds, the bullies would just walk away stunned and us kids got to play  in peace again.

As the days went on, Bill’s role as an unexpected protector of children became a known thing with the kids in the neighborhood. Some kids would just like to watch him freak out like he was some sideshow act. Others would just enjoy the peace his benevolent shouting fits would bestow upon us kids. Not everyone liked him, but nobody hated him.

When it started to get dark at night, Bill would walk away; presumably to go home. But he seemed to just walk across Brighton Beach Avenue and walk towards the boardwalk. Maybe he lived there? Seriously, the area underneath the boardwalk was not filled in during the 1970s and there were definitely people living there in some way back then. But he seemed too clean—and never seemed to have sand or dirt on him—to be someone living out on the beach like that. But wherever he went to, he would always come back in the afternoon the next day.

Bill hung around the block for a few weeks and then—without any warning or reason—just disappeared. With him gone, this meant us kids had to fend for ourselves while whatever bullying nonsense happened and the yentas sat around silently saying nothing. And my mom ended up buying slightly less muenster cheese as a result as well; with Bill gone who needs to spend money on extra cheese? But at least for a few weeks we all got to know Bill and realize even though he was damaged, a burnout, an acid casualty, or possibly a mental patient he was still a good guy.
