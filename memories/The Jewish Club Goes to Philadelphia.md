## The Jewish Club Goes to Philadelphia
### About the Time in High School the Jewish Club Went to Philadelphia and Got Kicked Out for Smoking Pot

By Jack Szwergold

The “Jewish Club” was a social club at school that seemingly popped out of nowhere. One day, we were told this club existed and this woman—whose name was Akiva—would be coming by once every few weeks to run meetings of the club. Akiva wasn’t a teacher and this club was not connected to the high school or the New York City Board of Education so this was all a bit weird, but it seemed innocuous.

Basically, once every few weeks Jewish kids in the school would spend the equivalent of one period a week just doing stuff together. It wasn’t necessarily strictly connected to religious stuff—it was more of a social club and such—but when holidays came around Akiva would organize activities or put together little lessons or projects that somehow were connected with the holiday.

Then one day in the spring she told us that they were organizing a trip to Philadelphia and we were all welcome to join. She was fairly vague on the details of the trip, but she basically made it sound like we were all going to Philadelphia for a basic weekend trip with shared hotel rooms and such. It didn’t sound like an amazing trip, but it sounded pretty cool nonetheless. We were all juniors in high school, boys and girls were mixing together, there were hormones aplenty so why not get out of Brooklyn for a weekend of whatever and whatnot?

So lots of folks signed up for the trip and a few weeks later we were off to Philadelphia. I’m actually a bit vague on how we actually got there, but I believe we all planned on meeting up at Penn Station in Manhattan and then heading out to Philadelphia. There was the usual young adult social bullshit on the train ride over with the added dimension of everyone’s Sony Walkmans or Sanyo/Sharp/Whatever being plugged in so we could tune out. Orange headphones and earbuds all in place.

When we arrived it Philadelphia it was dusk and it didn’t look like anything amazing because we weren’t anywhere amazing: We were in the parking lot of a hotel that could have been pretty much anywhere. We got our room assignments and we all headed to our mutuals rooms.

The rooms themselves were dumpy, but adequate. While walking through the hallways I got to see some of the other kids who showed up for this trip. Some of them looked like us—normal American teens—but others seemed like young Orthodox kids in training with men in white shirts and black pants and women in long, uncomfortable looking dresses and skirts. Heck, they weren’t men or women! They were just teenagers. But they all seemed like teenagers on their way to either squeezing out an Orthodox family in Borough Park or working behind the counter at some sketchy camera store in midtown.

Anyway, after getting settled in my room with whoever my roommate was, some guy came around to let us all know we needed to come down to the dining. Seemed to make sense since it was around dinner time anyway. So off I went!

Ran into some classmates in the hallway and we all compared our minimal notes: Rooms kind of sucked, there were more Orthodox kids than we expected but hey… Food! So we all walked down to the dining room area.

When we showed up the room was filled with folding chairs and no signs of food past some small, light snacks from what we could see. We all meandered around and found other familiar faces. There was a slight buzz around things and then—suddenly—all of the doors to the dining room were locked closed. Not only were the doors closed, but they were all guarded by some fairly strong looking Orthodox guys with their arms folded. What the fuck was happening?

Just about the time that the doors closed, someone showed up on stage and told us all to sit down. He had a few more muscle-bound Orthodox lunks hanging out near him.

We all sat down and listened to whatever this guy was going to say. And it basically boiled down to this: We were all going to be going to special, Jewish “classes” and lectures during this weekend and after that was all done there would be a short trip to Philadelphia to do touristy things. We all turned to look to each other and try to understand what was happening, but then at one point the guy used the word “Sheraton” and a few of us understood what was happening.

Basically, a shabbaton is a religious retreat held on the weekend designed to reinforce and educate Jews about their Jewish heritage. Superficially, that sounds cool if you were religious and believe a weekend of Bible (aka: Torah) studying was a fun thing to do. But pretty much none of the kids from my high school—except for a few exceptions—were religious in any way. We were all secular Jews who respected our heritage but didn’t do much else past that. So this whole shabbaton nonsense was utter bullshit: We were duped into going some crazy religious retreat when all we wanted to do is see Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell and eat a Philly Cheesesteak or two.

At some point they let us stand up to get some snacks but wouldn’t let us leave the dining room. I ran into Valerie—who was cute, new girl in the school—and I started to flirt with her the only way I knew how at the time: I asked her to pretend to kick me in the leg in hopes that somehow me being injured would convince one of those muscle-bound Orthodox lunks to let us go back to our rooms.

“What?You want me to kick you in the leg?” she said questioningly. “Yes!” I said and then looked to two of her friends standing near her who both started to understand what I was driving. “Yeah,” said one guy, “He wants you to pretend to kick him so we can get out of here.” She shrugged and then kicked me hard in the right leg. This wasn’t a fake kick, but it was a real kick.

“Ow!” I said, “Why did you do that?” I asked as I hopped a few steps back. “Well you said I should kick you?” She responded. “Yeah, I said you should *fake* a kick,” I responded while rubbing my right leg, “Not actually kick me!”

I looked up towards the doors, and those muscle-bound Orthodox lunks started to open them up while someone on a loudspeaker said we could head back to our rooms. So we all headed back to our rooms with more questions than answers.

We all gathered at a classmate’s room and talked it over. As we listened to someone’s mix tape we all agreed that this was all too weird: We were told we were going to go on some fun trip to Philadelphia but now it seemed like we were sequestered into some oddball hotel outside of Philadelphia where some muscle-bound Orthodox lunks were going to lecture the finer points of Judaism to us whether we liked it or not.

“It’s fucked up,” said one of my classmates. “But it doesn’t seem like we can get out of this anytime soon so might as well make the best of it,” he said has he reached into his bag and pulled out a joint.

I’ve seen joints before—mainly the ones my sister’s abusive, pot smoking husband smoked—but never have been offered one myself. I was little apprehensive, but when it got passed to me I inhaled and was feeling fine. I passed the joint over to Valerie who looked at it, winced and then took a puff. “Nice hole,” I said to her looking at the distressed knee hole on her jeans. “Thanks,” she said. And when I looked up my other classmates said they were going across the hall to someone else’s room to hang out. Me and Valerie were alone.

So we started to flirt. And Valerie was really cute. She was into 1980s fashion so she dabbled in making her own fashionish things: Cool hair wraps, shirts and even skirts. As I sat there on the edge of the bed, she was dressed pretty basically: White shirt and jeans and some cool earrings. We smoked the joint and at one point I grabbed her her right hand with my left hand, put my right hand on her right knee and we started to kiss and make out.

It wasn’t getting too hot and heavy, but my my hand started to move across her back and I could feel her bra strap—and feel her chest heave—just as our classmates burst into the room. “Get rid of that!” one of them said as they grabbed the joint out of my hand and ran to the bathroom. “What happened?” I asked, “Someone smelled the smoke and ratted on us.” And as he said that a few muscle-bound Orthodox lunks followed by the guy who was speaking to us on stage barged into the room.

“What were you doing here?!?” He said to nobody in particular. Valerie and I looked at each other and then the guy spoke in Hebrew to one of the muscle-bound Orthodox lunks who took Valerie away and left the rest of us guys to deal with him. “You’re all gone tomorrow!” He said, “But you need to call your parents right now to tell them why you are coming home.” And with that we were all dragged to some office in the building.

As we all sat down each one of us were forced to give the guy the telephone number to our parents and tell them bluntly we were kicked off of the trip because we were caught smoking marijuana. It was fairly brutal because it was about 10:30pm at night, and there was no subtlety or tact to the way the guy was dealing with it. Everyone else called their parents first and left the room after they made the call.

I was the last one to make the call and I pleaded with these overbearing assholes explaining that my parents were elderly Holocaust survivors so was there anyway I could call anyone else. The guy refused and I had no choice but to call and wake my dad up and say, “Hi dad. I’m coming home from the trip because I was smoking marijuana.” After I said that the guy in charge got on the phone shouting something to my father about how I was a bad kid and he was teaching me a lesson. He hung up the phone and I headed back to my room.

The next morning we all packed up our stuff and got ready to leave. While we were now shunned by these Orthodox shabbaton assholes, they did allow us to have breakfast in the hotel dining room. It was there where we learned the extent the gossip surrounding our expulsion from this weirdo religious trip. Some of the Orthodox Jewish girls who were eating breakfast next to our table passive-aggressively started to talk about us right in front. “I heard they found a pile beer cans outside their window and when they got in the room they also found cocaine,” she said eating her eggs and side glancing a glower or too towards us. Other people would just walk back and point and whisper but not say much.

“What is this bullshit?” I said, “We smoked one joint and now we had beer and cocaine too?” “I don’t know Jack,” said one classmate, “I don’t know.” And with that we finished up our breakfast and started to make our way out.

“Hey! Where is Valerie?” I asked as we walked down the hallway. “I guess they let her stay,” one classmate said to me shrugging. Before we left the hotel
