## The Jewish Club Goes to Philadelphia
### About the Time in High School the Jewish Club Went to Philadelphia and Got Kicked Out for Smoking Pot

By Jack Szwergold

The “Jewish Club” was a social club at school that seemingly popped out of nowhere. One day, we were told this club existed and this woman—whose name was Akiva—would be coming by once every few weeks to run meetings of the club. Akiva wasn’t a teacher and this club was not connected to the high school or the New York City Board of Education so this was all a bit weird, but it seemed innocuous.

Basically, once every few weeks Jewish kids in the school would spend the equivalent of one period a week just doing stuff together. It wasn’t necessarily strictly connected to religious stuff—it was more of a social club and such—but when holidays came around Akiva would organize activities or put together little lessons or projects that somehow were connected with the holiday.
