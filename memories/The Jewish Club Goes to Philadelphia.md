## The Jewish Club Goes to Philadelphia
### About the Time in High School the Jewish Club Went to Philadelphia and Got Kicked Out for Smoking Pot

By Jack Szwergold

The “Jewish Club” was a social club at school that seemingly popped out of nowhere. One day, we were told this club existed and this woman—whose name was Akiva—would be coming by once every few weeks to run meetings of the club. Akiva wasn’t a teacher and this club was not connected to the high school or the New York City Board of Education so this was all a bit weird, but it seemed innocuous.

Basically, once every few weeks Jewish kids in the school would spend the equivalent of one period a week just doing stuff together. It wasn’t necessarily strictly connected to religious stuff—it was more of a social club and such—but when holidays came around Akiva would organize activities or put together little lessons or projects that somehow were connected with the holiday.

Then one day in the spring she told us that they were organizing a trip to Philadelphia and we were all welcome to join. She was fairly vague on the details of the trip, but she basically made it sound like we were all going to Philadelphia for a basic weekend trip with shared hotel rooms and such. It didn’t sound like an amazing trip, but it sounded pretty cool nonetheless. We were all juniors in high school, boys and girls were mixing together, there were hormones aplenty so why not get out of Brooklyn for a weekend of whatever and whatnot?

So lots of folks signed up for the trip and a few weeks later we were off to Philadelphia. I’m actually a bit vague on how we actually got there, but I believe we all planned on meeting up at Penn Station in Manhattan and then heading out to Philadelphia. There was the usual young adult social bullshit on the train ride over with the added dimension of everyone’s Sony Walkmans or Sanyo/Sharp/Whatever being plugged in so we could tune out. Orange headphones and earbuds all in place.

When we arrived it Philadelphia it was dusk and it didn’t look like anything amazing because we weren’t anywhere amazing: We were in the parking lot of a hotel that could have been pretty much anywhere. We got our room assignments and we all headed to our mutuals rooms.

The rooms themselves were dumpy, but adequate. While walking through the hallways I got to see some of the other kids who showed up for this trip. Some of them looked like us—normal American teens—but others seemed like young Orthodox kids in training with men in white shirts and black pants and women in long, uncomfortable looking dresses and skirts. Heck, they weren’t men or women! They were just teenagers. But they all seemed like teenagers on their way to either squeezing out an Orthodox family in Borough Park or working behind the counter at some sketchy camera store in midtown.

Anyway, after getting settled in my room with whoever my roommate was, some guy came around to let us all know we needed to come down to the dining. Seemed to make sense since it was around dinner time anyway. So off I went!

Ran into some classmates in the hallway and we all compared our minimal notes: Rooms kind of sucked, there were more Orthodox kids than we expected but hey… Food! So we all walked down to the dining room area.

When we showed up the room was filled with folding chairs and no signs of food past some small, light snacks from what we could see. We all meandered around and found other familiar faces. There was a slight buzz around things and then—suddenly—all of the doors to the dining room were locked closed. Not only were the doors closed, but they were all guarded by some fairly strong looking Orthodox guys with their arms folded. What the fuck was happening?
