Happy 77th wedding anniversary to my mom and dad! Married on this day in 1945 in the literal aftermath of World War II devastated Poland. 💐

They both passed away within 6 months of each other in 1993. 

My dad was a soldier in Anders’ Army (aka: Polish II Corps or Polish Armed Forces in the East or the Polish armed forces in exile who’s officers were murdered in the Katyn massacre). He became a soldier in this “army in exile” after being liberated from the Gulag in Alma-Ata, Kazakhstan.

From 1939 to 1945 my mom was simply a teenage girl on the run with her mom and older sister in Poland and Ukraine and wherever else they could flee to.
