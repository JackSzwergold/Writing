# The Muppet Show

**Quick Notes**: About the time at a family gathering in Brighton Beach I was happily watching the Muppet Show with my niece. One of the few times I remember her smiling and laughing. My brother’s miserable wife was obsessed with the idea that the Muppets were not age appropriate, whispers to my brother and with that he just strolls over, looks at the TV and unceremoniously turns it off. My niece starts crying and I am yelling “Why?!?” at my brother who insists “It’s no big deal.” I turn to my niece and her face is red a she is screaming and crying. My sister drags her away and scolds her for making a scene.
