# The Muppet Show
## About the Time I Watched “The Muppet Show” with my Niece

It was a family visit on a spring or summer day in the late 1970s or early 1980s. Maybe it was a birthday or something like that. All I know is my brother and sister — and their mutual families — had invaded our Brighton Beach home.

Because I was the youngest of the siblings with a 20 year gap between us, I was often — effectively — an older brother to my nephews and nieces rather than the uncle I technically was.

I was no older than 12 or so and It was my job to play with the kids, entertain them and — generally — babysit them whenever a family event happened and the kids were around.

At first this was fun: My brother and sister — last being 20 years older than me — were miserable and abusive jerks. In contrast, their children were mostly fun to deal with during their pre-teen years. So it was cool to be able to play and hang out with family members that were closer in age to me than my actually siblings were.

That is it was fun unless my siblings came around and micro-managed the time we played together.

You see, despite the fact they trusted me in playing and entertaining their children when I was an adolescent, my siblings were still judgmental and hateful of our parents and out working class immigrant life. And they endlessly questioned the decisions I made as an adolescent. They hated their parents and they endlessly took it out on me by questioning the most trivial of things of my childhood life: Toys, food, music, books, etc… They read or heard something related to “good parenting” somewhere and that was that. It their over informed judgement versus anyone else’s individual judgement or agency.

And in the context of supposed “good parenting” the thing about the 1970s and 1980s was it was the burgeoning era of TV being looked at as a toxic poison for kids. TV was only seen as useful — and beneficial — if the overall presentation, intent and premise made the parents felt good.

Lord knows I had my TV watching habits over-scrutinized by my meddling siblings all the time. It got to the point where I learned that the best tact was often to just turn off the TV if they came around and avoid any TV-related conversation at all cost. But sometimes they slipped in their “good judgement” and that’s when I became a “cool uncle” to my nephews and nieces.

And on this day, I was a “cool uncle” to my niece Rebekkah who was 8 years younger than me; straight in the world of being 5 or 6 years old at the time.

It was one of those family gatherings where everyone was everywhere and nowhere. For the kids there was not much to do at all. But I had a small black and white TV in my room.

It was a beige and brown Sanyo and kinda junky, but it was a TV and it worked. I think my dad got it for a good price at one of the neighborhood junk stores, but that’s a whole other story. The core point being that at some point in my childhood my dad gave me this junky TV — that was previously used as a TV to use in our small kitchen — so I could watch TV on my own in my room without restriction.

So I had this TV in my room and after playing around with my niece with some stuff on the floor of my room, we both were bored and alone. So I looked at the clock, looked at her, and realized it was nearly 7:30pm and that meant “The Muppet Show” was about to come on.

“Hey! Do you want to watch ‘The Muppet Show’?” I asked her and she shyly nodded a “Yes.” And with that I flicked on the TV, turned the dial to channel 2 and away into the world of the Muppets we went.

I’m not going to pretend I remembered what exact episode or what specifics of the Muppet antics we were entertained by. All I know is this: This is one of the first times in my life I ever saw my niece smiling, happy and totally — and truly —enjoying herself.

It was one of those moments in my young life when I realized that what I used to think was happiness in her was kind of fake and kind of an act. Before that day, she would smile and go through the motions of happiness as if she was wearing a mask to make others happy, but today — as we watched “The Muppet Show” together — she was genuinely happy.

We sat on the floor and stared at that crappy black and white TV and enjoyed the Muppets doing whatever the heck they were doing. The moment was so pure and simple it felt like it would ￼last forever. But in reality it only lasted for about 10 to 15 minutes.

At around that time, my brother’s miserable wife — the source of all supposedly “good” parenting advice because she studied at the Bank Street School — wandered into my room, looked at us watching “The Muppet Show” and said with the breathlessly positive uptalk speech pattern of a pandering know-it-all teacher said, “Wow! So what are you watching here?” I simply responded, “The Muppet Show!” To which she nodded in acknowledgment, swallowed a pregnant pause or two and then said, “That show is not for children. It’s for adults.” To which I just pretty much said nothing about. I mean, what is a kid to say in response to an adult bluntly stating that a show filled with wacky puppets doing slapstick comedy — as well as song and dance — is somehow not for kids?

Anyway, she hovered over us and stared at us for a bit. In response we just mutually ignored her and kept on watching “The Muppet Show” as she watched us watch the show as if we were kids watching some unspeakably violent horror film or a porno film or something unwholesome like that.

After a minute or so, my brother came into my room, looked at his wife and said, “So? What is happening?” And with that she stared at us and then started to talk to him ion Hebrew. Of course me and my niece didn’t understand Hebrew and my brother and his wife knew that; they were talking behind our back and in front of us by talking to each other in another language.

Nothing good ever came from them talking in Hebrew in front of the children of this family.

After a few backs and forths between the, she left and my brother stayed. Unlike his wife, he stood their hovering over us as we watched and we could hear each breath of his he took. It was like a literal beast were standing over us. It felt menacing and it proved itself as such when he suddenly — without warning — just reached over our literal heads to turn off the TV.

The second second the TV turned off, my niece instantaneously burst into tears. One second she was smiling and happy, the next, red faced and full of tears. I turned around to my brother and screamed, “Why?!?” He looked at me, paused and then blurted a favorite bullshit line of his, “It’s no big deal.” He said that as my niece sat there red faced and crying; never once attempting to comfort her to simply acknowledge her tears. Nothing was a big deal to him; not even his own niece crying right in front of him because of his own actions.

Soon afterwards my sister showed up, knelt down and asked her daughter — my niece — what happened. My niece was fairly catatonic and dissociated and said nothing, so my sister just scolded and shook her for making a scene. “Why are you crying if nothing happened?” she said to her as she picked her up off the floor. My sister looked down at me with an accusatory stare that implied I had somehow had something to do with this. My brother stood nearby and similarly stared at me and said nothing. My sister didn’t speak Hebrew at all, so my brother couldn’t tell her what happened without me hearing it.

***

Soon she left my room and so did my brother. My room was empty and quiet and I could hear my niece sobbing in the hallway as my sister attempted to comfort her. I looked at the TV in my room and considered turning it back on, but I didn’t.

I waited a bit and — when the moment seemed right — I carefully closed the door to my room and locked it with the latch bolt I had installed myself in the past year or so. I wasn’t more than 12 years old at the time and I installed it to give me privacy and peace as a burgeoning adolescent. My mom and dad had no problems with it; which was great. They knew I didn’t really install it because of them as much as I installed it to give myself peace and privacy in cases like this.

I pulled my desk chair away from my desk and over to the window of my room and quietly stared out at the subway and sky. The view might might not seem peaceful to some, but staring at the sky, subway, seagulls and helicopters that passed by my window gave me a respite from the family bullshit of days like this one.
