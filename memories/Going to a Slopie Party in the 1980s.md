## Going to a Slopie Party in the 1980s

By Jack Szwergold

It was sometime in the 1980s. I want to say 1984 or 1985 since I was in high school and I heard about this party from friends of mine who were going to Midwood High School. Midwood was kinda the yuppie “magnet” high school in Brooklyn. I went to Lincoln where all the non-special, non-magnetized students went to.

While Lincoln was a high school that was a well mixed population of kids from Brooklyn, Midwood was the closest thing to a “preppie” high school that I knew of. Everyone who went to Midwood was well-to-do in some way. And I was definitely an outsider to that world.

The main reason I knew about this party and that crowd was from some friends of mine in Junior High School who happened to luck out and get into Midwood. We were still friends, but they were still somehow outsiders to Midwood and even to the neighborhood kids. Social stratification was happening… But we weren’t all aware of it yet. At the time we were just friends who saw each other less often becuase of social school rifts.

So anyway, one weekend I get a call from one of my friends. I thought he was calling to do our usual thing of going to “Video on the Bay” scoring a movie of some kind, scoring some kind of alcohol of some kind and just hanging out and watching a movie and getting drunk. Instead he told me that he got invited to a “Slopie” party and I should come along.

“Slopie?” I asked and he responded, “Yeah, some kids who live in Park Slope. They have their whole brownstone to themselves.” I barely knew what a brownstone was at the time, but didn’t ask; all I knew it was an expensive home of some kind in a part of Brooklyn far away from Brighton Beach. This was no apartment party… It was a house party of some kind and I was all for it.

So with that, I headed outside to hang out in front of the building on Ocean Parkway and wait for my ride. Which was always awkward.

While other buildings had security systems, doormen and even dogs, our building had a classic Brighton Beach security system: A bunch of Yentas just sitting outside on their folding chairs. They sat around, had some fresh air, gossiped to each other in Yiddish and stood watch.

It was kind of excruciating to be honest.

“Where are you going?” some would ask.

“Why don’t you go home?” others would insist.

In general if you spent more than 5 minutes in front of any buidling in Brighton Beach, the Yentas would start barking bullshit at you. Not for any reason other than that’s their life.

And just as I was about to get stressed by that Yenta bullshit, my friends pulled up in someone’s dad’s car.

I jumped in the back, and we headed up Ocean Parkway, onto the Belt Parkway and up to Park Slope.

I leaned over from the backseat and asked the obvious question, “So who’s party is this?” And my friends looked at each other, looked at me, shrugged and said, “Someone…” Turned out this was a general party that people in certain circles at Midwood High School somehow knew about. And we may or may not be crashing said party, but whatever. It was a full house party so who cared.

I’d been to parties before but this was a house party. I had some silly fantasy ideas of what that might mean. I pictured mutiple floors of a party happening. Kinda like what it seemed like in “Pretty in Pink” but less suburban.

As we turned onto one of the Park Slope streets I looked around for obvious signs of a party. None could really be found. Then we slowed down as we approached the building number we knew the party was happening in. Two kids in jeans and sandals with socks on them were hanging out on the stoop.

“This is it,” a friend said. And with that done, me and the friend who wasn’t driving jumped out while my other friend who was driving went to park the car.

“Hey,” I said to the kids sitting on the stoop. They said hey back, both looked at each other and then one said, “You don’t go to Midwood, right?” I looked at my friend and said, “Nope. I go to Lincoln.” And the kids on the stoop looked at each other and one of them said, “Lincoln? I think my dad went there.” And with that one of them passed a joint to the other person. Me and my friend were never offered.

And with that we headed inside the Brownstone to see what was up with the party. As we walked in nothing seemed dour, but not much seemed like a party. There was literally jusy a bowl of chips, a bowl of some pretzels and a cooler with a humble amount of beer in it. Some people were sitting around on a nearby couch, others on the stairs. Some music was playing, but it wasn’t too loud. A guy was sitting on the stairs either tuning or playing an accoustic guitar.

“Well, I guess this is it,” I said to my friend. We then both looked around and shrugged and decided to see what was happening upstairs.

As we walked towards the stairs the guitar guy on the steps blocked us and said, “Can’t go up there. Nothing is happening up there.” And with that we headed over to the bowls of chips and pretzels, grabbed a beer and just hung around.

After a while my other friend—who was parking the car—showed up. “So what’s happening?” And we all looked at each other and said, “This is it.” The trio of us checked the room, checked each other and collectively shrugged.

With that we just headed outside and sat on the stoop.

The night was quiet, the block was quiet and the stoop was quiet. It wasn’t that bad a night, but it was boring as hell.
