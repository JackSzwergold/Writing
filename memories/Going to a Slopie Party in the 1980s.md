## Going to a Slopie Party in the 1980s

By Jack Szwergold

It was sometime in the 1980s. I want to say 1984 or 1985 since I was in high school and I heard about this party from friends of mine who were going to Midwood High School. Midwood was kinda the yuppie “magnet” high school in Brooklyn. I went to Lincoln where all the non-special, non-magnetized students went to.

While Lincoln was a high school that was a well mixed population of kids from Brooklyn, Midwood was the closest thing to a “preppie” high school that I knew of. Everyone who went to Midwood was well-to-do in some way.
