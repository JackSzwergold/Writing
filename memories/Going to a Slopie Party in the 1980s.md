## Going to a Slopie Party in the 1980s

By Jack Szwergold

It was sometime in the 1980s. I want to say 1984 or 1985 since I was in high school and I heard about this party from friends of mine who were going to Midwood High School. Midwood was kinda the yuppie “magnet” high school in Brooklyn. I went to Lincoln where all the non-special, non-magnetized students went to.

While Lincoln was a high school that was a well mixed population of kids from Brooklyn, Midwood was the closest thing to a “preppie” high school that I knew of. Everyone who went to Midwood was well-to-do in some way. And I was definitely an outsider to that world.

The main reason I knew about this party and that crowd was from some friends of mine in Junior High School who happened to luck out and get into Midwood. We were still friends, but they were still somehow outsiders to Midwood and even to the neighborhood kids. Social stratification was happening… But we weren’t all aware of it yet. At the time we were just friends who saw each other less often becuase of social school rifts.

So anyway, one weekend I get a call from one of my friends. I thought he was calling to do our usual thing of going to “Video on the Bay” scoring a movie of some kind, scoring some kind of alcohol of some kind and just hanging out and watching a movie and getting drunk. Instead he told me that he got invited to a “Slopie” party and I should come along.

“Slopie?” I asked and he responded, “Yeah, some kids who live in Park Slope. They have their whole brownstone to themselves.” I barely knew what a brownstone was at the time, but didn’t ask; all I knew it was an expensive home of some kind in a part of Brooklyn far away from Brighton Beach. This was no apartment party… It was a house party of some kind and I was all for it.

So with that, I headed outside to hang out in front of the building on Ocean Parkway and wait for my ride. Which was always awkward.

While other buildings had security systems, doormen and even dogs, our building had a classic Brighton Beach security system: A bunch of Yentas just sitting outside on their folding chairs. They sat around, had some fresh air, gossiped to each other in Yiddish and stood watch.

It was kind of excruciating to be honest.

“Where are you going?” some would ask.

“Why don’t you go home?” others would insist.

In general if you spent more than 5 minutes in front of any buidling in Brighton Beach, the Yentas would start barking bullshit at you. Not for any reason other than that’s their life.
