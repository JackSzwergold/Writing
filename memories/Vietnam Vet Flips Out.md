## Vietnam Vet Flips Out
### About the Time an Upstairs Neighbor in the Building—Who was a Vietnam War Veteran—Flipped Out

By Jack Szwergold

**Quick Notes**: The time a neighbor on the fourth floor–apartment 4G–flipped out and got into a huge fight. He was a Vietnam war veteran and shit was literally flying out the kitchen window into the air shaft. Cops showed up and headed upstairs. One cop in charge sees me in the hallway in my socks and tells me to get some shoes. The guy is taken a way and a week or so later he comes back and is not n front of the building speaking to everyone and is apologizing and crying about what happened.
