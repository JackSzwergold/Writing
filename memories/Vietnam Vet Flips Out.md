## Vietnam Vet Flips Out
### About the Time an Upstairs Neighbor in the Building—Who was a Vietnam War Veteran—Flipped Out

By Jack Szwergold

This all happened sometime in the the mid-1980s. Not too sure I remember if the building went co-op and the new owners (aka: Overseas Investment Corp.) were in charge yet since the building was still in decent shape and new people were moving in every now and then. It was a healthy, normal flow of a lower class rental economy.

I don’t ever remember who lived on the 4th floor of the building before he moved in, but I do remember when he moved in. Mainly because he was Hispanic, had a big cookie duster of a mustache and had kinda a curly, almost-Afro-ish hair style. Not exactly like Oates of **Hall and Oates** but close enough.

I was a kid—and he was obviously a full-grown adult—so I had limited contact with him at best in day-to-day building life. But he seemed friendly whenever and wherever I saw him. Whether it was outside in front of the building, downstairs at the mailboxes, passing each other on the staircase or even waiting for a slice of pizza around the corner at Rocco’s, no matter when and when I saw him, he was generally a cool adult.

Then one weekend he just flipped out.

Like most every weekend when I was a pre-ten kid, I was puzting around and playing around in my room when suddenly I heard some random shouting coming from somewhere in the building. Which initially was no big deal since someone was always seemed to be shouting somewhere in the building—or near the building—at any given moment on most any day. Like the elevated train outside the window, you just learned how to block it out to get through the day.

But within a few minutes, the shouting started to become louder and louder and soon enough the dull sounds of random objects hitting floors and walls could be heard as well.

My dad ran into in my room to look out the window and try to figure out what was happening.

“What is happening?” my dad said to me as he peered out. My mom showed up in the hallway and added another, “What is happening?” to the mix.

Utterly nobody knew what was happening other than it was happening.

Soon enough there was a slight pause in the shouting and noise and you could hear the cracking thud of a wooden window frame being flung open. The quiet pause soon passed and was replaced with the sounds of even louder shouting and the noise of literal household bric-a-brac being flung out the window.

“Oh!” my dad exclaimed as he backed away from the window. I moved closer to the window crouched down and looked up and there I saw the commotion unfold in front of my eyes: It was a like a scene out of a cartoon with tons of forks, knives, cups and other random household crap just being tossed—seemingly endlessly—out the window.

My dad and mom opened the front door to hear what they could hear. But I wanted to see what I could see, so I ran into the hallway and looked up the stairwell. I could hear the same mix of shouting and noise but more muffled. I headed up the staircase to my sister’s apartment and checked out the view from her kitchen. The shouting and fighting and stuff flying out the window didn’t seem to end.

Then suddenly I heard someone shout something about the police, so I ran downstairs and waited in the hallway near my apartment.

Soon enough you could hear the sound of a small army of cops coming up the staircase. It had to be about 4 to 5 of them. One of them was clearly the commander in charge; he was tall, had white hair and barely tinted aviator sunglasses on. He takes one look of me standing in the hallway wearing just socks, turns to me and says, “Put on some shoes!!!” and then heads up the staircase.

After a minute or so you could hear the police heading into the apartment, the fight stopping and then the sound of the police and the guy coming down the staircase. He was handcuffed, but calm and police officers were guiding him down the stairs.

Following close behind was his wife or girlfriend—I was a kid so I had no idea what they were—slowly sobbing. Her face red and tears running down her cheeks.

She didn’t seem battered or bruised, but she was clearly screwed up. She headed down the stairs, and I headed into the apartment, put on some sneakers and headed downstairs.

There was a small crowd in front of the building, a few NYPD cars and an ambulance. I saw the guy from the 4th floor being led into the ambulance. He seemed dissolved but calm. Police were getting back into their cars and the small cadre of Yentas—who were standing up to see what was happening—slowly sat down and went back to being Yentas from a more comfortable position.

I hung around and heard what I could hear. Since most of the Yentas were properly gossiping in Yiddish, I had no clue what was they were saying.

Soon enough I saw my dad and Johnny—the superintendent of the building—talking to each other and headed outside. My dad was carrying a folding chair and so was my mom who was trailing a bit behind.

Johnny looked at me and smirked a “What can you do?” kinda smile. Things were weird because while people were gossiping and making a fuss, nobody seemed to be being too judgmental about the guy.

Johnny said something about the guy being a Vietnam war veteran and how the guy apparently had similar flip-outs in the past. It seemed like the guy’s Vietnam veteran status exonerated him from the judgement of the building Yentas and others.

A few weeks passed and I was coming home from something—school, the beach, window shopping or generally putzing about the neighborhood—when I saw the guy standing in front of the building talking to some people including Johnny and my dad.

I walked closer and he seemed calmer and cooler and a bit cleaned up. From what I could gather he was just let out of the hospital. I assume Coney Island Hospital that was just down Ocean Parkway a few blocks, but who knew.

He was clearly sad and crying a bit and was saying “I’m sorry…” to Johnny and others. Never saw a man crying and being honest like that in public.

I went back upstairs to my apartment and soon enough my dad followed. He asked me if I wanted anything to eat and said yes. No idea what he made for me, but I do remember him saying that it was sad the guy was a Vietnam War veteran.
