## Vietnam Vet Flips Out
### About the Time an Upstairs Neighbor in the Building—Who was a Vietnam War Veteran—Flipped Out

By Jack Szwergold

**Quick Notes**: The time a neighbor on the fourth floor–apartment 4G–flipped out and got into a huge fight. He was a Vietnam war veteran and shit was literally flying out the kitchen window into the air shaft. Cops showed up and headed upstairs. One cop in charge sees me in the hallway in my socks and tells me to get some shoes. The guy is taken a way and a week or so later he comes back and is not n front of the building speaking to everyone and is apologizing and crying about what happened.

It was sometime in the mid-1980s. The building was still in decent shape and new people were moving in every now and then.

I don’t ever remember who lived on the 4th floor of the building before he moved in, but I do remember when he moved in. Mainly because he was Hispanic, had a big moustache and had kinda a curly, almost-Afro-ish hair style.

I was a kid so I had limited contact with him at best. But he seemed friendly. Outside in front of the building, downstairs at the mailboxes, passing each other on the staircase or even waiting for a slice of pizza around the corner at Rocco’s. Wherever and whenever I saw him, he was generally a cool adult.

Then one weekend he flipped out.

I was playing around in my room when suddenly I heard some random shouting. Which was no big deal since someone was always seemed to be shouting somewhere in the building—or near the building—at any given momeent on most any day.

But the shouting started to become louder and louder and soon enough the sounds of objects hitting floors and walls could be heard as well.

My dad showed up in my room to look out the window and try to figure out what happened.
