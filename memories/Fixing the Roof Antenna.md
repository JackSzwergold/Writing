# Fixing the Roof Antenna

**Quick Notes**: Whenever a storm came by, the roof antenna wiring wound break. My dad would send me up to the roof and I would fix it with four tools: A box of matches, paper towels, scissors and electrical tape. I would cut the wire to trim it. Then cut down the center of the antenna insulation. Then melt off the insulation with a match. Pull the melted gunk off with the paper towel, splice the wires together by twisting them together. And seal it with electrical tape. Sometimes I used bandage tape that my parents would get from friends who worked as nurses in a hospital. Other times I might use duct tape. After I patched it up I would look around at the view. Not too many tall buildings nearby at the time. And the view was nice. The neighborhood looked nice from the roof as the trees blew in the wind.
