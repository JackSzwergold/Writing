# Fixing the Roof Antenna

It was the late 1970s or early 1980s. Honestly, it doesn’t mater much what period in time it was. All you need to know is that it was Brooklyn in the 1970s and nobody who was poor had cable. Heck, if you were poor and in the ass end of a Brooklyn there was no cable to be gotten if you wanted it. All TV was received by antennas. And in my family’s case it was received by a roof antenna.

The picture varied and we were lucky if we could get decent reception when weather happened. The signal would go in and out at my dad would often resign himself to the elements and just watch whatever channel came in clearest.

And then when the real bad weather came around, my dad would shout, “Jack!” and thus my life as an improvised antenna repairman began.

I would run into the living room, and my dad — and sometimes my mom — would be there to show me how none of the channels came in. “Look!” my dad would say and I would look and all I could see on the TV were 13 channels of garbage. Just static, distortion and noise.

And with that I would say, “Okay, I’ll go up and fix it.” And with that I would grab a jacket, grab some electrical tape, matches, scissors, pocket knife and some paper towels and head up to the roof.

“Be careful!” my mom would always say as I left the apartment and headed up to the roof.

Say what you will about NYC in the 1970s, but you could at least run up to the roof and not have to worry about it being locked or having one of those alarms set. And honestly — unless the weather was completely miserable — it was nice to go up on the roof. Outside of the cold and faceless towers of Trump Village, living in a 4 story building in Brighton Beach back then meant that you pretty much had an amazing view on the roof.

All the overgrown trees in the neighborhood — mostly the “Tree of Heaven” (Ailanthus Altissima) — looked genuinely beautiful swaying in the wind. The sky was always clear and the noise and bullshit of the street life below was muffled and ignorable. In retrospect, I should have spent more time on the roof as a kid; it was a pleasant respite from the daily grind of being a poor kid.

But back to the antenna.

I would get up to the roof, and see what happened. Happily most of the time wires broke — or were shorted out — at the base of the antenna. And if that was the case, my patching routine would begin.

First, I would remove whatever electrical tapes wrapped up the splice. This is where the scissors or pocket knife came into play. Once the damp, dirty and gummed up electrical tape came off, I then checked the wires in the slice to see if they could be reused in some way. Most of the time this was not the case, so I had to trim and strip the wires. This basically meant cutting off the junked up parts of both ends, cutting a small cut in the middle of the 75ohm wire and then pulling out the matches and paper towels. With each end cut, I would then pull out a wooden kitchen match, melt the plastic insulation and quickly pull it off. It wasn’t the cleanest way to strip a wire, but for cheap antenna wire it sufficed.

Once I did all for wires, I would twist them together and shout down the airway to my dad, “Check it now!” He would then run into the living roof from the kitchen, check the reception on the TV, and then run back to the kitchen, lean out and then report back. If things were good, I would seal up the splice with electrical tape and head back downstairs. If he said there were problems, I would run downstairs and check for myself to see what was up.

Most of the time, the issue was just fixed on the spot by me attaching and re-attaching wires on the back of the TV. Regardless, usually things were fixed.

After a splice was set and I was ready to go back downstairs, I would stay up on the roof and soak in the peacefulness of the trees, wind and the rumble of the subway trains rolling down Brighton Beach Avenue elevated line.

**Quick Notes**: Whenever a storm came by, the roof antenna wiring wound break. My dad would send me up to the roof and I would fix it with four tools: A box of matches, paper towels, scissors and electrical tape. I would cut the wire to trim it. Then cut down the center of the antenna insulation. Then melt off the insulation with a match. Pull the melted gunk off with the paper towel, splice the wires together by twisting them together. And seal it with electrical tape. Sometimes I used bandage tape that my parents would get from friends who worked as nurses in a hospital. Other times I might use duct tape. After I patched it up I would look around at the view. Not too many tall buildings nearby at the time. And the view was nice. The neighborhood looked nice from the roof as the trees blew in the wind.
