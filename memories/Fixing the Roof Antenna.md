# Fixing the Roof Antenna
### About the experience of being a pre-teen kid tasked with being the family antenna repair man.

It was the late 1970s or early 1980s. Honestly, it doesn’t mater much what period in time it was. All you need to know is that it was Brooklyn in the 1970s and nobody who was poor had cable. Heck, if you were poor and in the ass end of a Brooklyn there was no cable to be gotten if you wanted it. All TV was received by crappy antennas; either glorified wire hangars hanging off the back of your TV or — if you had roof access — a roof antenna of some kind. And in my family’s case it was received by a roof antenna.

The quality of the TV signal varied and we were lucky if we could get decent reception when any kind of weather happened. When the weather was bad, the TV signal would go in and out at my dad would often resign himself to the elements and just watch whatever channel came in clearest or at least had sound.

But then there were times when bad weather happened. And when bad weather happened, my dad would shout, “Jack! Come here!” and thus my life as an improvised pre-teen antenna repairman began.

When he called me like that, I would run into the living room, and my dad — and sometimes my mom — would be there to show me how none of the channels came in clear. “Look!” my dad would say and I would look and all I could see on the TV were 13 channels of static, distortion and noise.

And with that I would say, “Okay, I’ll go up and fix it.” I would grab my jacket, and grab my tools which consisted of the following: A roll of electrical tape, a box of kitchen matches, cheap school scissors, a pocket knife and some paper towels. With everything in hand and my jacket zipped up I would head up to the roof.

“Be careful!” my mom would always say as I left the apartment and headed up to the roof. Heck she said that whenever I left the apartment for any reason at all.

Say what you will about NYC in the 1970s — the crime, corruption, poverty an all that — but you could at least do something like run up to the roof of your building and not have to worry about it being locked or having one of those stupid alarms set. And honestly — unless the weather was completely miserable — it was actually nice to go up on the roof. Outside of the cold and faceless towers of Trump Village across the street on one side of the building, living in a four story building in Brighton Beach back then meant that you pretty much had an amazing view of the neighborhood from the roof.

All the overgrown trees in the neighborhood — mostly the “Tree of Heaven” (Ailanthus altissima) — looked genuinely beautiful swaying in the wind. The sky was always clear and the noise, smells, squalor and bullshit of the street life below was muffled four stories. The bad stuff was all easily ignorable when you were literally above it all. In retrospect, I should have spent more time on the roof as a kid; it was a pleasant respite from the daily grind of being a poor kid.

But back to the storm damaged antenna.

I go up the stairs of building, go up the final set of stairs to the roof, push open the rickety door and get up to the roof, and see what happened. Happily most of the time the problem was just that connecting wires broke — or were shorted out — at the base of the antenna. And if that was the case, my patching routine would begin.

First, I would remove whatever electrical tape was wrapped up around the existing slice. This is where the scissors and pocket knife came into play. Once the damp, dirty and gummed up electrical tape came off, I then checked the wires of the splice to see if they could be reused in some way. Most of the time this was not the case, so I had to trim and strip the wires to create a new splice. This basically meant cutting off the junked up parts of both ends of the wire, cutting a small cut in the middle of the 75ohm wire and then pulling out the matches and paper towels. With each end cut, I would then pull out a wooden kitchen match, light it, melt the plastic insulation and quickly pull it off. It wasn’t the cleanest — let alone most professional — way to strip wire, but for cheap , low voltage antenna wire it sufficed.

Once I completed a new splice — and before I sealed it up with electrical tape — I would shout down the airway to my dad, “Check it now!” He would then run into the living roof from the kitchen, check the reception on the TV, and then run back to the kitchen, lean out and then report back. If things were good, I would seal up the splice with tape and head back downstairs. If he said there were problems, I would run downstairs and check for myself to see what was up.

Most of the time, the issue was just fixed on the spot by me attaching and re-attaching wires on the back of the TV. Regardless, usually things were fixed.

After a splice was set I would take a breather to enjoy the view and peacefulness the roof provided. I would stay up there and soak in the quirky peacefulness of the trees, wind and even the rumble of the rickety 1970s subway trains as they rolled down Brighton Beach Avenue elevated line. Every once in a while I looked at the roof hardware and wondered if I could sling up a hammock just big enough for a kid like me to lay down and take a nap in.

 But that was always for another day that sadly never came.
