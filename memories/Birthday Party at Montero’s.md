# Birthday Party at Montero’s 

**Quick Notes**: A friend in the neighborhood — Anne — was having a birthday party at Montero’s. She invited everybody in her world on Facebook and via bulk email. I just recently met her; she was a Gawker commenter who talked about the neighborhood and I reached out to her.

Long story short, nobody showed up. Just me and this asshole Glen Fred. She knew him from art school at SVA. He was endlessly talking about going to school with Basquiat and what SAMO meant. I knew all of that already but he was just schooling me as if I was an idiot.

He also talked about grittiness and realness. He talked about it in counter to me talking about moving to Park Slope in the 1990s; implying I was soft. I told him my background and he was kinda stunned. He still talked about the realness of his life.

The evening ended. He kept on talking about how he liked the bar because of how gritty and real it seemed. He liked how “weird” the bartender looked.

End of the night he headed home to Remsen Street. After all that lecturing on realness, he lived on one of the priciest streets in Brooklyn.

Years later he published a graphic novel about his life. Turns out he came from a fairly wealthy New Jersey suburb.
