## Trading Video Games with Beven
### About Learning About How a Neighborhood Friend Lived

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: Trading copies of Atari video games with Beven. Describe his family including his dad who would refinish furniture in their apartment, his mother yelling at one of Beven’s brothers to sit on the crappy washing machine. And describe his mother wearing some night dress with a stain on the front crotch who would constantly insinuate that I was reading games for free because I wanted something else. Paranoid assholes who treated basic niceness as a “threat.”

Beven was a new kid in Junior High School. I didn’really know him much past seeing him in class. He seemed normal-ish but had signs of being quirky.
