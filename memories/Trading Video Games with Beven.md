## Trading Video Games with Beven
### About Learning About How a Neighborhood Friend Lived

By Jack Szwergold

Beven was a new kid in Junior High School. I didn’t really know him much past seeing him in class. He seemed normal-ish but had signs of being quirky. Like the basic way he carried and composed himself, stains on his clothes and—most notably—the odd, beat up briefcase he carried around with him at all times.

While the rest of us had some of basic kid backpack—like a Jansport or an Eastpack or some generic olive drab Musette bag—this guy came to class with a beat-up, dark brown leather briefcase that looked like it was discarded on a pile of trash. It was beat to hell—and the frayed seams made you wonder if the leather was real or some kind fake crap—but he liked it and used it. Whenever he came to class he’d nonchalantly just place it on a desk, pop the clasps and open it up to reveal… A pile of papers and related school supply crap. He also liked to use beat-up legal pads instead of regular notebooks but that’s another story entirely.

Anyway, I barely knew Beven but one day me and a friend were talking about trading video games in class. I was really into getting some new stuff I read about in magazines, stuff like “Caverns of Mars” or “Defender” or other cool stuff, but I didn’t know where to get them from so I was asking around. 

Beven overheard the conversation, came over to our desk and said “Hi!” to my friend—who he knew better than me—and before you knew it I was introduced to him. “If you are looking for games, I have some,” he said as he opened up his beat up briefcase to show off an oddball pile of seemingly randomly ordered floppy disks he had with him.

“Check this out!” he said as he passed me a fairly beat up 5 1/4 inch diskette. The label had some messy scribbles on it and I could barely make out what it said so when I said I couldn’t read it, he rifled off a list of games that were on that disk and said, “I can sell them to you… Three games for $10.”

I looked at the disk in my hand, looked at Beven, looked at my friend, winced my face and simply said, “Bullshit. We should just trade.” His face was stoic but smiling in a forced “shit eating grin” smile to which he added a simple disarming salesman laugh to.

“So you want to trade? Well, what do you have?” he said, and before I could say anything my friend interrupted and said, “Jack’s got lots of stuff! You should invite him over to trade!”

I was kinda thrown for a loop about that. I had some cool stuff, but I was by no means an “elite” pirate or anything. I just had lots of the basic cool stuff most everyone had or wanted at the time: Crappy “Pac-Man” clones, some Adventure International text adventure games and other sundry stuff. But anyway, I agreed to come over “Sometime…” and we left it at that.

A week or so passed and I was at my friend’s house—playing and copying some games—when my friend asked me, “Hey! Did you ever trade games with Beven?” “Nope,” I replied. “I don’t even know where he lives.” My friend told me he lived around the block so we should go over that afternoon. I kinda sheepishly agreed to go but before I knew it he was on the phone to Beven.

While I packed my stuff up ready to head over to Beven’s place, Beven actually came over to my friend’s house with his beat up briefcase filled with floppy disks and—yet again—tried to sell us video games. “Dude, we’re not buying games. You can just copy them. Just get some blank disks and all is good.” Beven flipped through his disks, looked through his briefcase, looked around and said, “I don’t have any blank disks here. But I have some at home. I can go back and…” and before you knew it my friend said we should just go over to Beven’s place.

“I guess that would be cool,” said Beven and before you knew it we were over at Beven’s place.

Beven’s family lived in a pre-War tenement apartment building—similar to the ones pretty much everyone in the neighborhood lived it—but his apartment was weird. It was really dark and filled with busted or dismantled furniture. It‘s as if they just landed in the apartment and dumped all the stuff they owned there and that was that.

“Sorry,” Beven said as we made ourselves into the apartment, “My dad refinishes old furniture,” he added. “Just walk over there,” he said while pointing to an improvised desk made out of a dining table that was near the entrance to the kitchen at the far end of the living room.

We made our way through the piles of crap, got closer to the table and saw a small TV set connected to an Atari 800 and 810 disk drive sitting unceremoniously on the table. The chairs near the computer setup were a mishmash of junky dining room tables and other non-office chairs. We each picked a chair and sat down.

“Who’s that?” said some young kid’s voice coming from deeper in the apartment. It was Beven’s younger brother Douglas.

“That’s Jack and Matt,” Beven said. “We’re going to trade games.” Douglas slowly came over and checked us out. If Beven was a disheveled and scrappy pre-teen peer, Douglas was a bit messier with some visible dirt on his face, dried up snot on his nose, and a huge ripped hole on his stained white t-shirt.

“Oh!” Douglass said in a way that was neither judgmental or glib.

“Hey!” said another voice coming out of the kitchen. It was Bradley, the middle kid in the family. Unlike Beven or Douglas, Bradley looked somewhat presentable with a flannel button down shirt tucked neatly into his pants. But was still twitchy in his own way.

“Hey Bradley!” Matt and I said. We actually have met Bradley before in the neighborhood playground and he was cool, but he was always a bit uncomfortable in a way that seemed to imply “You believe I was born into this shit?”

“So what do you got?” Douglas said as I opened up my crammed carrying case of disks. “I’ve got ‘Caverns of Mars,’ ‘Pac-Man’ and ‘Donkey Kon…” and then without any hesitation Douglas shouted “DONKEY KONG!!!”

“Wow! Donkey Kong?” said a woman’s voice coming out of the kitchen. It was Beven’s mother who looked like she just got up from a nap, “That sounds cool. You want that Douglas?” “Yeah,” he said.

“Okay, no problem… You got it!” I said. And everyone stopped talking and stared at me. Apparently the whole family expected some extended negotiation connected to this. “You’re just gonna give it to us for free?” she said to which I responded, “Yeah… Why not? Just give me a blank disk and it’s yours.”

I looked around and Beven was nervously eyeing his mom while trying to find a blank disk somewhere in the pile of crap on the kitchen table to give me to copy “Donkey Kong” onto.

“Really? Just like that Jack,” she said in a semi-intimidating way, standing there with her arms on her hips. It was really a strange and awkward scene. Everyone was silent and here is the family matriarch just standing there and giving a 14 year old kid (aka: me) the 3rd degree because I was willing to give her son a copy of the game for free.

“Okay, if that’s what you say, Jack,” she said as she turned to Beven. “You have a disk, Beven?” to which he responded, “I’m looking! I’m looking!”

“I want to play ‘Donkey Kong!’” Douglas whined as he looked at my pile of disks.

“We can play it now while Beven is looking for a blank disk. Is that okay?” I said to which Beven said “Sure.”

I shifted myself in the rickety kitchen chair, turned on the Atari 810 disk drive, stuck the disk in, turned on the Atari 800, turned on the TV set and attempted to get the setup all ready for Douglas to play “Donkey Kong” on.

“Hello!!!” said a man’s voice coming from the front of the apartment as we heard the door open. ”Beven’s got some friends over?” he added. It was Beven’s dad—sweaty and panting—carrying some beat up headboard as he walked into the apartment.

Beven introduced me to his dad and I shook his hand. He was smiling but very sweaty, red faced and exhausted; he was wearing a wife-beater t-shirt, wool pants and some beat-up leather dress shoes that clearly have seen better days.

After he shook my hand he went over to hug his wife. As she moved towards him my friend and I could clearly see she wasn’t wearing anything underneath her dingy, pink nightie as she passed in front of a table lamp. You could see the silhouette of her body through the light but it was as far from an erotic as one could imagine. Then—as she turned to us to ask if we wanted a snack—we could see the huge discolored stain on the front of her nightie near her waist.

“No thank you! We already ate!” I said as the computer finally loaded “Donkey Kong.”

“Here!” I said to Douglas as I gave him a joystick to play.

“Wow! Look at that!” Beven’s dad said as he peered at Douglas playing the game. “You have fun now, I gotta do some work…” he said as he moved towards the front of the apartment, grabbed some rags and a bottle of something and started to rub the stuff on to the furniture.

He was clearly stripping paint from the wood since the fumes were pretty intense. Intense enough that  started to feel dizzy. Nobody else seemed to be affected by the fumes so I spoke up and asked Beven’s mom if she could open up the kitchen window. “Oh, okay Jack,” she said again using my name as if it was a stick she was poking me with.

She reached over to open the window and a few seconds later the air cooled up a bit, the fumes became less intense and it was easier to breathe. “Thank you,” I said as she looked over towards the washing machine.

“Hey! I forgot to start the wash!” she said as she opened and closed the lid to the machine, turned a knob and started it up. The kitchen lights dimmed briefly as she turned on the machine but the computer was still running as expected.

I turned back to Beven, Douglas and Bradley to see what was up in our little video game world. Beven seemed to had finally found a blank floppy disk, but Douglas was still playing the game. All three of them stared at the screen as Douglas incompetently—but enthusiastically—played the game. 

Some more time passed and we all played for a bit. Things were actually calm, cool and collegial until the washing machine started to suddenly knock back and forth. The lid was even starting to open up a bit and everyone seemed to be ignoring it.

“Douglas!!!” Beven’s mom shouted from the hallway, “Go and sit on the washing machine before it spills!!” What? Spills? My family had a similar washing machine but I don’t recall it ever spilling. Anyway, I looked at Douglas and he was happily playing the game, but you could watch his face wince up and get tense.

“Douglas!!!” she shouted yet again.

And with that Bradley unceremoniously grabbed the joystick out of Douglas’s hand. Douglas sat catatonically for a second, but his face grew redder and redder as each second passed. Before you knew it Douglas stood up, started crying and climbed onto the top of the washing machine just sat there as his mother demanded.

“Douglas!!!” she shouted again to which Douglas shouted “I’m sitting on it mom!!!”

I looked at Douglass sitting there on the washing machine as it shook back and forth, but the lid was closed thanks to his weight. No water was going to spill out if the machine thanks to Douglas’s efforts, but Douglas sat there crying, red faced, with his limp legs gently shaking back and forth with the motion of the machine.

Turning back to the computer, I watched as Bradley tried to play “Donkey Kong” but failed miserably. He stunk worse than Douglas at playing the game, but didn’t get upset about it. He also didn’t get upset at his brother crying on the top of washing machine. Neither did Beven. Neither did Matt. Neither did his dad who was still wiping wood with turpentine from the beginning of this mess without uttering a word to anyone.

“Here!” Beven said as he gave me a beat up floppy disk. “Copy it on this one.”

I poked Bradley to get him to stop playing and before you knew it I had copied “Donkey Kong”—and a few other games—for him and passed it back to him.

“Thanks! You want stuff? I can give you new games when I get them,” he said, “And then we can sell them to the other kids.” He still didn’t get it. It was simple enough for me to copy the games so who cares. But I responded, “Okay, when you get some new games, okay?”

“Deal!!!” he said enthusiastically as he took the disk from me and put it back into his pile of seemingly randomly labelled disks.

His mom came back into the kitchen as the sun was setting and turned on the light. With the bright light of a bare, circular florescent light shining you could clearly see the whole kitchen scene: Douglas—red faced and sobbing—sitting on the crappy washing machine, his young ass apparently the only thing preventing the piece of junk from exploding all over the place. And next to him his mom standing there in a dingy pink nightie; seemingly the only piece of “around the house” clothes she owned.

“You want some dinner, Jack?” she said as she opened up the cupboard. “Nah,” I said, “It’s getting late and I gotta go home!” 

And with that I started to pack up my stuff. Beven’s dad stopped stripping the furniture, came up to us and looked on the screen, “You get some good stuff today, Beven?” to which he responded, “Yeah!”

Nobody really seemed to acknowledge we were leaving, so my friend and I slowly walked to the front of the apartment, figured out how to open the front door on our own and said goodbye to the whole family.

Everyone waved and said goodbye including Douglas who was still red faced and sitting on top of the washing machine as it shook back and forth as we closed the door and headed outside.
