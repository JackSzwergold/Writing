## Trading Video Games with Beven
### About Learning About How a Neighborhood Friend Lived

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: Trading copies of Atari video games with Beven. Describe his family including his dad who would refinish furniture in their apartment, his mother yelling at one of Beven’s brothers to sit on the crappy washing machine. And describe his mother wearing some night dress with a stain on the front crotch who would constantly insinuate that I was reading games for free because I wanted something else. Paranoid assholes who treated basic niceness as a “threat.”

Beven was a new kid in Junior High School. I didn’really know him much past seeing him in class. He seemed normal-ish but had signs of being quirky. Like the basic way he carried himself, stains on his clothes and—most notably—the brifcase he carried around.

While the rest of us had some of basic kid backpack—like a Jansport or an Eastpack or some generic olive drab Mussette bag—this guy came to class with a beatup, dark brown leather briefcase. It was beat to hell—and the frayed seams made you wonder if the leather was real or some kind fake crap—but he liked it and used it. Whenever he came to class he’d non-chalantly just place it on a desk, pop the clasps and open it up to reveal… A pile of papers and crap. He also liked to use beatup legal pads but that’s another story entirely.

Anway, I barely knew him but one day me and a friend were talking about trading video games. Mainly Atari video games. Some new stuff was out that I wanted but didn’t know where to get it from. Maybe “Caverns of Mars” or “Defender?” I don’t know. Anway, Beven came over to our desk, said hi to my friend, was introduced to me and then opened up his beat up crappy briefcase to show off some games he had.

“Check this out!” he said as he rifled through the pile of scraps and crap in his bag to reveal a fairly beat up 5 1/3 inch diskette. The label had some messy handwriting on it and he clearly used a hole punch to be able to use the flip side of the disk. “See!” he said and then rifled off a list of games and siad, “I can sell them to you, three for $10.”

I winced up my face and said, “Bullshit. We should just trade.” His face was stoic but smiling in what I would grow up to know was a shit eating grin followed by a simple laugh. “You want to trade? What do you have?” he said, and before I could say anything my firend interupted and said, “Jack’s got lots of stuff. You should invite him over to trade!”

I was kinda quizical about that. I had some stuff. But I was by no means an “elite” pirate or anything. I just had lots of the basic stuff: Crappy Pac-Man clones, some text adventure games and other stuff. But anyway, I agreed to come over “Sometime…” and we left it at that.

A week or so passed and I was at a friend’s house playing and copying some games when my friend asked me, “Hey! Did you ever trade with Beven?” “Nope,” I replied. “I don’t even know where he lives.” My friend told me he lived around the block so we should go over that afternoon. I kinda sheepishly agreed ane before I knew it he was on the phone to Beven.

Beven actually came over to my friends house with his beat up briefcase and—yet again—tried to sell us games. “Dude, we’re not buying games. You can just copy them. Just get some blank disks and all is good.” Beven opened his briefcase, looked around and said, “But I don’t have any blank disks here. But I have some at home. I can go back and…” and before you knew it my friend said we should just go over to Beven’s place.

“I guess that would be cool,” said Beven and before you knew it we were over at Beven’s place.

Beven’s family lived in a pre-War tenement apartment building but his apartment was weird. It was really dark and filled with busted or dismantled furniture.

“Sorry, my dad refinishes old furniture.” Beven said as we walked in. “Just walk over there,” he said while pointing to an improvised desk made out of a dining table that was near the entrance to the kitchen.

We made our way through the piles of crap and saw a smll TV set connected to an Atari 800 and 810 disk drive sitting unceremoniously on the table. The chairs near the setup were a mish-mash of junky dining room tables. We each picked a chair and sat down.

“Who is that!” said some voice from deeper in the apartment. It was Beven’s younger brother Douglas.

“That’s Jack and Matt. We’re going to trade games,” Beven said as Douglas checked us out. If Beven was dishelved and scrappy, Douglas was worse with visible dirt on his face, snot on his nose
