## Trading Video Games with Beven
### About Learning About How a Neighborhood Friend Lived

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: Trading copies of Atari video games with Beven. Describe his family including his dad who would refinish furniture in their apartment, his mother yelling at one of Beven’s brothers to sit on the crappy washing machine. And describe his mother wearing some night dress with a stain on the front crotch who would constantly insinuate that I was reading games for free because I wanted something else. Paranoid assholes who treated basic niceness as a “threat.”

Beven was a new kid in Junior High School. I didn’really know him much past seeing him in class. He seemed normal-ish but had signs of being quirky. Like the basic way he carried himself, stains on his clothes and—most notably—the brifcase he carried around.

While the rest of us had some of basic kid backpack—like a Jansport or some generic olive drab Mussette bag—this guy came to class with a beatup, dark brown leather briefcase. It was beat to hell—and the frayed seams made you wonder if the leather was real or some kind fake crap—but he liked it and used it. Whenever he came to class he’d non-chalantly just place it on a desk, pop the clasps and open it up to reveal… A pile
