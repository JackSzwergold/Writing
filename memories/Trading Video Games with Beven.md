## Trading Video Games with Beven
### About Learning About How a Neighborhood Friend Lived

By Jack Szwergold

Beven was a new kid in Junior High School. I didn’t really know him much past seeing him in class. He seemed normal-ish but had signs of being quirky. Like the basic way he carried and composed himself, stains on his clothes and—most notably—the odd, beat up briefcase he carried around with him at all times.

While the rest of us had some of basic kid backpack—like a Jansport or an Eastpack or some generic olive drab Musette bag—this guy came to class with a beat-up, dark brown leather briefcase that looked like it was discarded on a pile of trash. It was beat to hell—and the frayed seams made you wonder if the leather was real or some kind fake crap—but he liked it and used it. Whenever he came to class he’d non-chalantly just place it on a desk, pop the clasps and open it up to reveal… A pile of papers and realted school supply crap. He also liked to use beat-up legal pads instead of regular notebooks but that’s another story entirely.

Anyway, I barely knew Beven but one day me and a friend were talking about trading video games in class. I was really into getting some new stuff I read about in magazines, stuff like “Caverns of Mars” or “Defender” or other cool stuff, but I didn’t know where to get them from so I was asking around. 

Beven overheard the conversation, came over to our desk and said “Hi!” to my friend—who he knew better than me—and before you knew it I was introduced to him. “If you are looking for games, I have some,” he said as he opened up his beat up briefcase to show off an oddball pile of seemingly randomly ordered floppy disks he had with him.

“Check this out!” he said as he passed me a fairly beat up 5 1/4 inch diskette. The label had some messy scribbles that seemd handwriting on it and he clearly used a hole punch on the left side of the disk to be able to use the flip side of the disk for extra storage. “See!” he said and then rifled off a list of games and said, “I can sell them to you, three for $10.”

I winced up my face and said, “Bullshit. We should just trade.” His face was stoic but smiling in what I would grow up to know was a shit eating grin followed by a simple laugh. “You want to trade? What do you have?” he said, and before I could say anything my friend interrupted and said, “Jack’s got lots of stuff. You should invite him over to trade!”

I was kinda quizzical about that. I had some stuff. But I was by no means an “elite” pirate or anything. I just had lots of the basic stuff: Crappy Pac-Man clones, some text adventure games and other stuff. But anyway, I agreed to come over “Sometime…” and we left it at that.

A week or so passed and I was at a friend’s house playing and copying some games when my friend asked me, “Hey! Did you ever trade with Beven?” “Nope,” I replied. “I don’t even know where he lives.” My friend told me he lived around the block so we should go over that afternoon. I kinda sheepishly agreed and before I knew it he was on the phone to Beven.

Beven actually came over to my friends house with his beat up briefcase and—yet again—tried to sell us games. “Dude, we’re not buying games. You can just copy them. Just get some blank disks and all is good.” Beven opened his briefcase, looked around and said, “But I don’t have any blank disks here. But I have some at home. I can go back and…” and before you knew it my friend said we should just go over to Beven’s place.

“I guess that would be cool,” said Beven and before you knew it we were over at Beven’s place.

Beven’s family lived in a pre-War tenement apartment building but his apartment was weird. It was really dark and filled with busted or dismantled furniture.

“Sorry, my dad refinishes old furniture.” Beven said as we walked in. “Just walk over there,” he said while pointing to an improvised desk made out of a dining table that was near the entrance to the kitchen.

We made our way through the piles of crap and saw a small TV set connected to an Atari 800 and 810 disk drive sitting unceremoniously on the table. The chairs near the setup were a mishmash of junky dining room tables. We each picked a chair and sat down.

“Who is that!” said some voice from deeper in the apartment. It was Beven’s younger brother Douglas.

“That’s Jack and Matt. We’re going to trade games,” Beven said as Douglas checked us out. If Beven was disheveled and scrappy, Douglas was worse with visible dirt on his face, snot on his nose, and a huge ripped hole on his stained white t-shirt.

“Oh!” Douglass said.

“Hey!” said another voice coming out of the kitchen. It was Bradley, the middle kid in the family. Unlike Beven or Douglas, Bradley looked somewhat presentable with a flannel button down shirt tucked neatly into his pants.

“Hey Bradley!” Matt and I said. We actually have met Bradley before and he was cool, but he was always a bit shaky in a way that seemed to imply “You believe I was born into this shit?”

“So what do you go?” Douglas said as I opened up my carrying case of disks. “I’ve got Caverns of Mars and Pac-Man and Donkey Kong…” and then without any hesitation Douglas shouted “DONKEY KONG!!!”

“Wow! Donkey Kong?” said a woman’s voice out of the kitchen. It was Beven’s mother who looked like she just got up from a nap, “That sounds cool. You want that Douglas?” “Yeah,” he responded.

“Okay, no problem… You got it…” I said. And everyone stopped talking and stared at me. Apparently the whole family expected some negotiation to this. “You’re just gonna give it to us for free?” she said to which I responded, “Yeah… Why not? Just give me a blank disk.”

I looked around and Beven was eyeing his mom while trying to find a blank disk somewhere in the pile of crap on the kitchen table.

“Really? Just like that Jack,” she said in a semi-intimidating way, standing there with her arms on her hips. It was really a strange scene. Everyone’s silent and here is the family matriarch just standing there and giving a 14 year old kid (aka: me) the 3rd degree because I was willing to give her son a copy of the game for free.

“Okay, if that’s what you say, Jack…” she said turning to Beven. “You have a disk, Beven?” to which he responded, “I’m looking! I’m looking!”

“I want to play Donkey Kong!” said Douglas as he looked at my pile of disks.

“Look, we can play it now while Beven is looking. Is that okay?” I said to which Beven said sure.

I shifted myself in the rickety chair, powered up the Atari 810 disk drive, stuck the disk in, powered on the Atari 800, powered on the TV set and attempted to get the setup all ready for Douglas to play Donkey Kong on.

“Hello!!! Beven’s got friends over?” said a man’s voice coming from the front of the apartment. It was Beven’s dad carrying some beat up headboard as he came into the apartment.

Beven introduced me to his dad and I shook his hand. He was smiling but sweaty and exhausted; he was wearing a wife-beater t-shirt, wool pants and beat-up dress shoes. After he shook my hand he went over to hug his wife. As she moved towards him me and Matt could see she wasn’t wearing anything underneath her dingy nightie. You could see the silhouette of her body but it was as far from erotic as one could imagine. As she turned to us to ask if we wanted a snack we could now see the huge stain on the front of the crotch of her nightie.

“No thank you! We already ate!” I said as the Atari finally loaded Donkey Kong.

“Here!” I said to Douglas as I gave him a joystick to play.

“Wow! Look at that!” Beven’s dad said as Douglas played the game. “You have fun now, I gotta do some work…” he said as he moved towards the front of the apartment, grabbed some rags and a bottle and started to rub stuff on the furniture. He was clearly stripping paint from the wood. The fumes were strong and I started to feel dizzy. Nobody else seemed to be affected so I spoke up and asked Beven’s mom if she could open up the kitchen window. “Oh, okay Jack,” she said again using my name as if it was a stick she was poking me with.

She reached over to open the window and in a few seconds the air cooled up a bit and was easier to breathe. “Thank you,” I said as she looked down on the washing machine.

“Hey! I forgot to start the wash!” she said as she opened and closed the lid to the machine, turned a knob and started it up.

I turned back to Beven, Douglas and Bradley. Beven seemed to had finally found a disk, but Douglas was still playing the game. All three of them stared at the screen as Douglas incompetently—but enthusiastically—played the game.

Some more time passed and we all played for a bit until the washing machine started to knock back and forth. The lid was starting to open and everyone seemed to be ignoring it.

“Douglas!” Beven’s mom shouted from the hallway, “Go and sit on the washing machine before it spills!” What? Spills? Anyway, I looked at Douglas. He was happily playing the game, but you could watch his face prune up.

“Douglas!!!” she shouted.

And with that Bradley grabbed the joystick out of Douglas’s hand. Douglas sat catatonic for a second, but his face grew redder and redder as each second passed. Before you knew it he stood up, started crying and climbed up to the top of the washing machine and sat on it.

“Douglas!!!” she shouted again to which Douglas shouted “I’m sitting mom!!!”

I looked at Douglass sitting there on the washing machine as it shook back and forth, but the lid was closed. No water was going to spill out if the lid, but Douglas sat there crying, red faced with his legs gently shaking back and forth with the motion of the machine.

I turned back to the Atari. Bradley tried to play Donkey Kong but really stunk. He didn’t get upset about it. But he also didn’t get upset at his brother crying on the top of washing machine. Neither did Beven. Neither did Matt. Neither did his dad who was wiping wood with turpentine from the beginning of this mess without uttering a word.

“Here!” Beven said as he gave me a beat up floppy disk. “Copy it on this one.”

I poked Bradley to get him to stop playing and before you knew it I had copied the games for him and passed it back to him.

“Thanks! You want stuff? I can give you new games when I get them,” he said, “And then we can sell them to the other kids.” He still didn’t get it. It was simple enough for me to copy the games so who cares. But I responded, “Okay, when you get some new games, okay?”

“Deal!” he said as he took the disk from me.

His mom came back into the kitchen. The sun was setting so she turned on the light. With the bright light of a bare, circular florescent light shining you could see the whole kitchen scene: Douglas—red faced and sobbing—sitting on the crappy washing machine, his young ass the only thing preventing the piece of junk from exploding all over the place. And next to him his mom standing there in a crappy pink nightie with a big stain right over her crotch.

“You want some dinner, Jack?” she said as she opened up the cupboard. “Nah,” I said, “I gotta go home!” 

And with that I started t pack up my stuff. Beven’s dad came up to us and looked on the screen, “You get some good stuff today, Beven?” to which he responded, “Yeah!”

Nobody really seemed to acknowledge we were leaving, so Matt and I slowly walked to the front of the apartment, figured out how to open the front door and said goodbye to the whole family.

Everyone waved and said goodbye including Douglas who was still sitting on top of the washing machine as it shook back and forth as we closed the door and headed outside.
