# Oscar Party on the Westside of Madison

Nathan Rabbit and Keith Phelp’s Oscar party. A horseshit WASPy event at best. I feel bad saying that but I also have to be honest; going to those Oscar parties were so painfully Lutheran I can’t even.



Keith handed out Oscar voting sheets. Nathan acted like a high functioning adult having an episode. I showed him some discarded electrical bill I saw on the ground. He snapped “So what?” at me and threw it back on the ground. I was drunk. Was going to walk home.

Stephen walked me home to make sure I got home. It was weird. I was fine walking home and nobody bothered me. We spotted a dunk passed out on some lawn.
