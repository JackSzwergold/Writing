# Unhelpful Rent Strike Lady

At some point around high school, I felt like being an activist. It wasn’t a great idea.

The building was sold sometime in the early 1980s and was falling apart. The place was turning into a real dump. And the new management company wasn’t doing much.

So after hearing about people who organized for tenants rights, I contacted some local group to get something done. Naively I did not factor in the fact that nobody else in the building wanted to “make trouble” as people in poor neighborhoods say.
 So she showed up. She seemed Israeli. She was short, had short hair and unshaved legs with sandals on. I explained to her what the situation was and her only real advice is they could not do anything unless the tenants organized. So what did I do? I printed up a flyer regarding a rent strike and ran around the building shoving the flyer beneath every apartment door.

It was a horrible idea. Nobody really wanted to “make trouble.” And since I was one of the few people in the building who spoke up, I was instantly identified as the person who made these flyers.

Nobody organized anything and if anything I made my parents feel like more of a  target than making them empowered.

The big lesson I learned is in many poor neighborhoods, people will complain about landlords treating them like crap, but few will actually do anything about it. And in the case of our building, attempting to organize failed miserably and pretty much made me — and my family — a target of gossip and bullshit. At the end of the day the only way to deal with a situation like that is to leave the apartment altogether. Too bad my family was poor and had no resources to effectively do that.
