## The Crown Royal Bag of Jewelry

By Jack Szwergold

It was sometime in the 1980s, and my mom wanted to go out to get something from the supermarket across the avenue. It was either called Met Foods or Speedway; don’t remember when the name switch happened but it was still the same supermarket even with branding changes.

It was sometime before the place closed—maybe 7:00pm or 8:00pm—when she headed out. “I need to buy something,” she said as she headed out the front door. My dad and I really didn’t know what she had to get, but who knew. We really didn’t stock up on anything past the basics in the pantry and my dad knew what we had. She most likely heard about something from one of her co-workers at the Gowanus sweatshop she worked in.

Anyway, after about 20 minutes or the front buzzer rang, my dad went to the front door to open it up for her and she pretty much ran into the apartment. Not like a sprinter, but faster than her usual stroll.

She started to excitedly whisper to my dad in Polish or Yiddish—definitely not English—as they both hurried into the apartment and into the kitchen.

After a pause, I stood up, headed into the kitchen to see what the fuss was about.

I walked in, saw the grocery bag sitting on the kicthen table, but it was still full. My mom and dad though were opening up a Crown Royal bag on the table and going through the contents.

“What’s in there?” I asked. And as my mom and dad looked at me I looked at the table and saw lots of gold and shiny things. “Jewelry,” my dad said. My mom added, “I find this in the street between this side and the other side,” which I knew, in her broken English, to me meant she found it on the median between traffic between our building and the supermarket.

I came closer and looked and checked out the haul: Lots of jewerly. Lots of gold. Real or fake? No clue. But lots of gold chains. Other stuff too but mainly gold chains.

I felt excited. No idea what anything was worth—or where this Crown Royal bag came from—but I knew one thing: My mom would sell it at the local jewerly store a few blocks away.

“Don’t tell anybody,” my dad said. And I knew what he meant. Life was hard enough without neighborhood Yentas, gossips and low lifes knowing that we found this haul.

Who owned this stuff? Was the stuff stolen? Did it all belong to one person if stolen? Was there anyway to return the stuff?

Nothing was practically of concern at that moment past the fact that whatever my mom just found was worth something. And to a family that was poor, that meant some kind of magical bonus that could help us survive. And that’s what was important.
