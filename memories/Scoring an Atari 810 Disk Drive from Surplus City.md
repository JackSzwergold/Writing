## Scoring an Atari 810 Disk Drive from Surplus City

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: The store was called “Surplus City” and it was basically a huge junk store. They would buy damaged and unsold items from department stores, pile it up in their shop and just sell it. One day while goofing around with neighborhood friends, I spotted the distinctly beige case of an Atari 810 disk drive in the window. Smashed unceremoniously among the schmatas and detritus that made up the store. I found out it was for sale for $25 which was a huge bargain since it sold new for around $300 at the time. I ran home to tell my dad. He went back to the store with me. We bought it, but it was missing the data cable and power cable so I learned how to look through the phone book and call up places to get the parts I needed.
