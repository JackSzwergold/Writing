## Scoring an Atari 810 Disk Drive from Surplus City

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: The store was called “Surplus City” and it was basically a huge junk store. They would buy damaged and unsold items from department stores, pile it up in their shop and just sell it. One day while goofing around with neighborhood friends, I spotted the distinctly beige case of an Atari 810 disk drive in the window. Smashed unceremoniously among the schmatas and detritus that made up the store. I found out it was for sale for $25 which was a huge bargain since it sold new for around $300 at the time. I ran home to tell my dad. He went back to the store with me. We bought it, but it was missing the data cable and power cable so I learned how to look through the phone book and call up places to get the parts I needed.

I was 13 or 14 and had an Atari 400 I got for my bar mitzvah. It was a mixed bag of a gift if I ever got one. While I liked the fact that I could play video games on it, the gift—which was ostensibly from the “whole family” but in reality from my brother and his wife at time—was loaded with expectations. Instead of playing games all day, my brother and his wife expected me to be an instantaneous programming genius who wrote video games instead of mindlessly playing them.

I was 13 or 14 and all I wanted to do was play video games. But they cost too much and—besides—owning a computer like this in the early 1980s was a “rich kid” thing. And my family was far from rich.

So I learned how to pirate games instead.

Since I only had a Atari 410 cassette tape drive at the time, pirating was easy-ish. I figured out how to connect two portable radios with cassette decks with an improvised 3.5mm headphone jack dubbing cable made from the leftover cables of two busted 3.5mm stereo headphones.

While the cable was electrically crap and literally held together with cheap scotch tape and not much else. But if someone I knew had a cool Atari game on a cassette tape, all I needed was a blank tape, that cable and two cassette recorders and some time to dub myself a copy.

But that is also a long way of saying that dubbing cassette tapes in realtime was/is a very tedious and time consuming process.

Depending on how big the game was, dubbing tapes could take a lot of time. Also, unless your home had two cassette recorders, you had to borrow a cassette recorder from someone and that became a whole production.

At the end of the day, cassette tapes for data sucked and my dream as a kid was getting a disk drive. But they were expensive and my family was poor.

The base model Atari 810 disk drive retailed for around $299 back in the early 1980s and that was basically close to the cost of the Atari 400 I had.

My $2 a week allowance was good for small kid things, but even if I didn’t spend it it would take me nearly 3 years to save that up on my own.

So I was resigned to my life of being stuck with data cassettes for the glorified video game system my Atari 400 became.

One day I was playing around Brighton Beach Avenue and ran past the window of Surplus City. As the name implied, the place was a classic mom and pop junk store located around tons of other mom and pop junk stores in the neighborhood. My mom liked the place, and I actually enjoyed rummaging through the place with my mom when she dragged me along on one of her bargain hunting trips.

On this day it was just me and a bunch of kids horsing around when I noticed something in the front window of Surplus City. There mixed in with the literal tons of smashed, stacked and shoved schmatas on a shelf on a window was the unmistakable brownish beige color of an Atari peripheral.

I walked closer to the window and checked it out and based on what I could see, it looked like it was either an Atari 810 disk drive or an Atari 820 receipt printer.

I walked into the store and asked the old lady behind the counter if I could see it. She had no idea what I was talking about, so I had to guide her to pull it out of the pile of junk in the window.

And when she pulled it out, I was stunned: It was an Atari 810 disk drive!

“What is this? You want it?” she asked and I said yes. She shouted out to someone in the backroom asking for a price and they shouted back “Twenty five dollars! As is!”

“Okay! $25. You want it?” she asked. And I basically said, “Yeah, but I need to get the money.” And with that she put it behind the counter and said, “When you get the money come back.”

I walked out of the store and told my friends they wanted $25 for it. One responded, “That’s cheap! You should get it.” But someone else pointed out that it didn’t come with any cables and you can’t tell if it works. And they were right. But my thoughts were for $25 it was worth the gamble. And besides, my brother was an electrical engineer so he could help me fix it if need be.

I headed back home and told my dad about the disk drive. His response was “Twenty five dollars? Are you sure this is a good thing?”

“Yes!” I said. Also, when he started talking to my mom about it I realized she basically knew the people who owned the store so if the thing was dead and my brother couldn’t fix it, we could haggle them to accept a return.

“Okay, let’s go,” my dad said and with that we both headed outside.

The sun was setting but the shop was only about 4 blocks away.

I went into the store with my dad, the woman behind the counter recognized me and then pulled then Atari 810 disk drive out. “See!” I said as he looked it over. After a while he said, “Okay, good. We’ll take it.” And with that my dad handed over the $25, the woman placed the bare disk drive into a used, non-descript shopping bag and we headed back home.

When we got home, my dad handed me the bag and I took the disk drive out. Yup! It was an Atari 810 disk drive. And it looked clean and good. But without a power supply or data cable, there was no way I could test it out.

“Maybe you should talk to Ben about this?” my dad asked. And with that I went over to the phone and dialed up my brother.

***

I generally never called my brother directly and only really talked to him on the phone if he called up and asked for me or my dad called him up and he asked for me. So this was technically the first time I called him as an independent person asking him for help.

“Why did you buy this?” he immediately said when I told him about the disk drive. “It was cheap and I am sure it works!” I said, to which he responded “I don’t know. I don’t have time for this.” There was a pregnant pause and I simply said, “I’ll let you talk to dad.” And with that I passed the phone over to my father.

When my dad grabbed the handset I looked for a copy of the yellow pages and brought it to my room.
