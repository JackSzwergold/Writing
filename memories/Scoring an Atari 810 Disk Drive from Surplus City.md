## Scoring an Atari 810 Disk Drive from Surplus City

By Jack Szwergold

I was 13 or 14 and had an Atari 400 home computer I got for my Bar Mitzvah. That computer was a mixed bag of a gift if I there ever was one. While I liked the fact that I could play video games on it, the gift—which was ostensibly from the “whole family” but in reality from my brother and his overbearing wife at time—was loaded with expectations of use that I could not fufill. Instead of playing games all day, my brother and his wife expected me to be an instantaneous programming genius who wrote video games instead of mindlessly playing them.

While I became a programmer as an adult, at the time I was just 13 or 14 years old and all I wanted to do was play video games, not make them. But software—especially video games—cost too much back then. And besides that, owning a computer like an Atari 400 in the early 1980s was a “rich kid” thing; and my family was far from rich. So I made due with the small handful of games I got as part of the Bar Mitzvah gift package to entertain myself.

That is until I learned how to pirate software.

I might have only had a measely Atari 410 cassette tape drive at the time, but pirating was a fairly easy skill to pick up. All one had to do was figure out how to make an exact copy of a cassette tape and you were good to go! In my case I figured out how to connect two portable radios with cassette decks via an improvised dubbing cable made from the salvaged cables of two busted 3.5mm stereo headphones.

While from a quality standpoint the cable was crap—and literally held together with cheap Scotch tape and not much else—it did the job. If someone I knew had a cool game on a cassette tape, all I needed to do to get a copy of that that game was to get a blank cassette tape, borrow a friend’s cassette deck to hook up to mine with that cable, hit play on one deck, record on the other and some time later I would have my own copy of that game.

And that description makes the dubbing process sound simple. And to be completely honest dubbing tapes of any kind—audio or data—is, indeed, a simple process. But dubbing tapes in real-time is also a very tedious—and time consuming—process.

Depending on how large—from a raw data standbpoint—the game was, dubbing cassette tapes could take a lot of time to do. And borrowing a friend’s cassette recorder was often a small political battle in and of itself since they would often want a copy of the game as well, thus doubling the amount of time I would have to spend making a copy of a game.

At the end of the day, dubbing cassette tapes to get a copy of a game sucked and my dream as a kid was getting a real disk drive. They were faster, could store more data than a cassette tape and copying them was relatively easier than copying cassettes since disk drives didn’t require that data be copied in real time.

But disk drives were expensive peripherals in the early days of computing and my family was poor.

The base model Atari 810 disk drive retailed for around $299 back in the early 1980s and that was basically close to the $499 cost of the Atari 400 I had.

My $2 a week allowance was good for saving up for small kid things like toys, comics and books. But even if I stopped buying stuff and dilligently saved up my weekly allowance it would take me nearly 3 years to save up $299 on my own.

So I was resigned to my life of being stuck with dealing with data cassettes for the glorified video game system my Atari 400 became.

One day I was playing around Brighton Beach Avenue with some friends and ran past the window of of a neighborhood shop called, “Surplus City.” As the name implied, the place was a classic, old school, NYC mom and pop junk shop located around tons of other mom and pop junk shops in the junky neighborhood I lived in. That said, I had nothing against junk shops: My mom liked the place and I genuinely enjoyed rummaging through the piles of junk in that place with my mom when she dragged me along on one of her neighborhood bargain hunting trips.

But on this day it was just me and a bunch of kids horsing around when I noticed something in the front window of “Surplus City.” There mixed in with the literal tons of smashed, stacked and shoved clothes, schmatas and accesories on a shelf in the window was the unmistakable light brownish beige color of an Atari peripheral.

I walked closer to the window and checked it out and based on what I could see, it looked like it was either an Atari 810 disk drive or an Atari 820 receipt printer.

I walked into the store and asked the old lady behind the counter if I could see it. She had no idea what I was talking about, so I had to guide her to pull it out of the pile of junk in the window.

And when she pulled it out, I was stunned: It was an Atari 810 disk drive!

“What is this? You want it?” she asked and I said yes. She shouted out to someone in the backroom asking for a price and they shouted back “Twenty five dollars! As is!”

“Okay! $25. You want it?” she asked. And I basically said, “Yeah, but I need to get the money.” And with that she put it behind the counter and said, “I’ll hold it for you. When you get the money come back.”

I walked out of the store and told my friends they wanted $25 for it. One responded, “That’s cheap! You should get it.” But someone else pointed out that it didn’t come with any cables and you can’t tell if it works. And they were right. But my thoughts were for $25 it was worth the gamble. And besides, my brother was an electrical engineer so he could help me fix it if need be, right?

I headed back home and told my dad about the disk drive. His response was “Twenty five dollars? Are you sure this is a good thing?”

“Yes!” I said. Also, when he started talking to my mom about it I realized she basically knew the people who owned the store so if the thing was dead and my brother couldn’t fix it, we could haggle them to accept a return.

“Okay, let’s go,” my dad said and with that we both headed outside.

The sun was setting but the shop was only about 4 blocks away.

I went into the store with my dad, the woman behind the counter recognized me and pulled then Atari 810 disk drive out. “See!” I said as he looked it over. After a while he said, “Okay, good. We’ll take it.” And with that my dad handed over the $25, the woman placed the bare disk drive into a used, nondescript shopping bag and we headed back home.

When we got home, my dad handed me the bag and I took the disk drive out. Yup! It was an Atari 810 disk drive. And it looked clean and good. But without a power supply or data cable, there was no way I could test it out.

“Maybe you should talk to Ben about this?” my dad asked. And with that I went over to the phone and dialed up my brother in his place in Washington Heights.

***

I generally never called my brother directly and only really talked to him on the phone if he called up and asked for me or my dad called him up and he asked for me. So this was technically the first time I called him as an independent person asking him for help.

“Why did you buy this?!?” he immediately shouted over the phone when I told him about the disk drive. “It was cheap and I am sure it works!” I said, to which he responded “I don’t know. I don’t have time for this.” There was a pregnant pause and I simply said, “I’ll let you talk to dad.” And with that I passed the phone over to my father.

When my dad grabbed the handset I looked for a copy of the yellow pages and brought it to my room.

I flipped through to the electronics section, then the computer section and started to look through the listings. I was looking for some kind of official Atari repair place and soon I found one: They were located on the Upper West Side—which was another planet compared to the ass end of Brooklyn I lived in—but they seemed legit; their ad had lots of logos and they were proud to be in business for a seemingly decent amount of time.

I wrote down the phone number and address of the place and showed it to my dad after he got off the phone with my brother.

“I think they have the parts we need,” I explained. And my dad nodded and said it was too late to call them up so I should call them the next day.

***

The next day I called them up. The guy on the phone seemed to think it was a joke or something that some young kid was calling him up asking about an Atari 810 disk drive cable.

“Sure we have that. Power supply too,” the guy said, “So what are your hours I asked?” and with that I made note of the hours, cost and everything and shared it with my dad.

“Okay, next weekend. Good?” he said and I agreed.

By the time the next weekend rolled around, my dad had already figured out what train we needed to take. I am pretty sure we needed to get to 72nd Street on the Upper West Side and my dad had already mapped it out.

So we headed out there, got of the train and headed to some tree-lined block filled with old buildings. When we got to the place, it wasn’t a regular storefront but rather one of those “basement of a brownstone” stores that just had some tin sign hanging out front near the garbage cans and staircase that lead to their store.

I went downstairs with my dad and headed to the counter. Seemed like the place was a purely service and repair shop so it made sense they were in this basement space. The guy behind the counter was a bit stunned when he realized I was the kid that called up a week earlier, but was happy to oblige.

He pulled out what looked to be a clean and solid homemade Atari disk drive cable—official cables were all black while this one was bluish grey—and an official Atari disk drive AC adapter, wrote out a receipt, my dad paid for it and we headed outside and back home.

I had a diskette a friend let me borrow, so all I had to do was hook the thing up to the Atari 400 and see if it worked. And lo and behold, it booted! It worked! I was so excited and happy!

“It works?” my dad said. “Yes!” I shouted; happy and excited. My mom waddled over to my room to see what was happening and my dad explained it to her.

“This was cheap, right?” she asked to which I replied, “Yes, it was!” And I pulled out some catalog or newspaper ad to show her the retail price for it. “$299 and you pay $25? Very good!” she said kissing me on my head.

Yeah, a Jewish mother was proud of her Jewish son getting something at a deep discount. But who cared? It was a bargain and it worked great!

Then the phone rang. It was my brother doing his weekly check in.

My dad briefly mentioned that the Atari disk drive worked and then passed the phone onto me.

“So it works?” my brother asked and I replied, “Yes! It works!” 

He then grilled me on how I got a cable and power supply and I explained how I found a store.

His voice was noticeably angry when I mentioned the power supply and he said, “You don’t need an Atari power supply! You can use any kind of power supply!”

As he shouted at me I was at a loss. This was the same person who refused to help me initially when I asked him to and now he’s yelling at me because I bought an official Atari part?

“It works,” I replied. Then there was a pregnant pause and he asked to be passed back to my dad and I did.

While my dad talked to my brother on the phone, I went back to my room and played around with Atari DOS. Sure it was a boring system utility, but I needed to learn how to use it if I was going to use that disk drive to load and copy games.

My family might have been poor, but at least we were resourceful and knew how to best use what little we had and whatever we scavenged from whatever junk store or pile of garbage we gleaned stuff from.
