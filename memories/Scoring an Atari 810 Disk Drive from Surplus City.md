## Scoring an Atari 810 Disk Drive from Surplus City

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: The store was called “Surplus City” and it was basically a huge junk store. They would buy damaged and unsold items from department stores, pile it up in their shop and just sell it. One day while goofing around with neighborhood friends, I spotted the distinctly beige case of an Atari 810 disk drive in the window. Smashed unceremoniously among the schmatas and detritus that made up the store. I found out it was for sale for $25 which was a huge bargain since it sold new for around $300 at the time. I ran home to tell my dad. He went back to the store with me. We bought it, but it was missing the data cable and power cable so I learned how to look through the phone book and call up places to get the parts I needed.

I was 13 or 14 and had an Atari 400 I got for my bar mitzvah. It was a mixed bag of a gift if I ever got one. While I liked the fact that I could play video games on it, the gift—which was ostensibly from the “whole family” but in reality from my brother and his wife at time—was loaded with expectations. Instead of playing games all day, my brother and his wife expected me to be an instaneous programming genius who wrote video games instead of mindlessly playing them.

I was 13 or 14 and all I wanted to do was play video games. But they cost too much and—besides—owning a computer like this in the early 1980s was a “rich kid” thing. And my family was far from rich.

So I learned how to pirate games instead.

Since I only had a Atari 410 cassette tape drive at the time, pirating was easy-ish. I figured out how to connect two portable radios with cassette decks with an improvised 3.5mm headphon jack dubbing cable made from the leftover cables of two busted 3.5mm stereo headphones.

While the cable was electrically crap and literally held together with cheap scotch tape and not much else. But if someone I knew had a cool Atari game on a cassette tape, all I needed was a blank tape, that cable and two cassette recorders and some time to dub myself a copy.

But that is also a long way of saying that dubbing cassette tapes in realtime was/is a very tedious and time consuming process.

Depending on how big the game was, dubbing tapes could take a lot of time. Also, unless your home had two cassette recorders, you had to borrow a cassette recorder from someone and that became a whole production.

At the end of the day, cassette tapes for data sucked and my dream as a kid was getting a disk drive. But they were expensive and my family was poor.

The base model Atari 810 disk drive retailed for around $299 back in the early 1980s and that was basically close to the cost of the Atari 400 I had.

My $2 a week allowance was good for small kid things, but even if I didn’t spend it it would take me nearly 3 years to save that up on my own.

So I was resigned to my life of being stuck with data cassettes for the glorified video game system my Atari 400 became.
