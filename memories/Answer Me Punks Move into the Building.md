# Answer Me Punks Move into the Building

I didn’t know they were connected to “Answer Me!” when they moved it, but I knew they were punks. They dressed like it and they were the first interaction I had with punks in my life. I was just a teen. They were assholes. They would harass all of the neighbors for utterly no reason all the time. And after they moved in, the apartment was trashed.

What’s interesting to note is that they’re moving in coincided with the building being sold. It was sold to some “Overseas Investment Corp.” That’s when the building fell to crap. Things weren’t maintained and a few years later the ceiling would collapse in the bathroom while my dad was taking a shower.

I had no idea what gentrification meant. And lord knows Brighton Beach was never gentrified. But these a-holes being allowed to move into the building and harass me and my neighbors was clearly the first step in a plan to turn the building into co-ops.
