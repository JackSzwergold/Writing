# Going to Canal Street and Learning How to Solder in 5th Grade

**Quick Notes**: About the time my brother dragged me to Canal Street in the late 1970s and we went to tons of electronics and related junk stores. It was fun, but what I found to be fun was not what he found to be fun.

He would attempt to teach me how to solder, but none of his rambling bullshit “teaching” techniques worked for me. I had no idea what I was doing and it was as if he were giving a 10 year old kid vocational training for some factory job.

Anyway, instead of soldering electronics, I would use pieces of copper I bought and solder to create an old school armor helmet for my Iron Man action figure. I showed it to my brother and he would say, “Why did you do this? Why did you make this garbage?” I would put it away in a drawer and tell my dad what he said. My dad would comfort me, but I would be so upset about it that I would eventually just crush the armor into a small ball and throw it in the garbage.
