# Man Having a Seizure on Brighton 6th Street

**Quick Notes**: It was some time in the fall in the early 1980s, I was around 11 or 12 years old and I was walking down Brighton Beach Avenue when I saw a guy collapsed on Brighton 6th Street near Brighton Beach Avenue. I was shocked. I was just walking around the neighborhood trying to kill time; checking out corner store vending machines and the occasional video game if I spotted one when I saw the guy collapsed.

I walked over and saw him flat out on his back on top of one of those metal basement entry hatches. Clearly having a fit. Shaking and not responsive. Old Russian men and women walked by, pointed it him and showed no concern.  One guy even just walked over and kicked the bottom of his shoe and spoke to someone else in Russian.

I had no idea what to do, but I remembered passing seeing a cop car parked on Brighton Beach avenue near Brighton 5th Street right near the doughnut shop. I ran over to the cops in the car. They were drinking coffee and eating and I told them about the guy. They humored me more than responded to me and said they would look into it.

I walked back to the corner where the guy was laid out. People were still just passing by him and doing nothing. Showing no concern. I stood and stared and felt numb. I looked back at the cop car and they were still parked there in front of the doughnut shop doing nothing. I felt even more numb.

After a while, I just left and walked down the avenue to Bertaâ€™s discount store. They had a Moon Cresta machine in there. I played a few games and then walked back home.
