## Post-Traumatic Data Recovery Stress

By Jack Szwergold

It was a spring or summerish day in the late 1990s. I would guess it was 1999 or so. And for the record, all of this happened over the span of 15 to 20 minutes or so; so hey.

I was working my day at the wacky weekly newspaper place and found out a former staffer (Danny) was visiting.

Danny was a writer and editor in the pre-fame days of the wacky weekly newspaper when it was mainly a college focused beer and pizza rag with jokes to match. Nowadays the newspaper still thrived off of ad revenue from pizza and beer places but the content was far more sophisticated and focused to a national audience.

But that is no disrespect to Danny: He is the one who pioneered a more interesting kind of content in the publication and should be considered a founding editor moreso than others who have been given more credit than due in the publication’s later years.

But anyway, I’m digressing. Danny was visiting the publication again after leaving it in the context of a (justifable) rage quit a few years before.

I barely knew him, but others knew him and the visit was a big deal.

I said “Hello.” And he was fairly cold, “Oh, I know you…” he said in an aggresively passive aggresive way. There was a constant simmering hostility between old staff and new and there’s not much that could be done other than grin and bear it adn just let it pass.

He walked passed me, down the small hallway in the office and headed into the writer’s room where he was all smiles, laughs and warmly greeting old co-workers.

I went back to work doing whatever. At the time I was either putting together pizza and beer ads or working on something on the publication’s website.

It was a bright and sunny afternoon and—as dumpy as the office I was in was like—there was at least a nice view down Main Street of the sunset over the town.

A few hours later I was winding down and ready to go home. I was bullshitting with some co-workers in the design department when suddenly Todd ran into the office.

“Jack! You have to help!” I looked at him, looked at my co-workers, they turned around and got back to getting ready to go home and I stood up and followed Todd back to his desk.

By this time in the history of the publication, the egos were getting quite ripe. Newfound fame thanks to the Internet had made big fish in a small pond even bigger fish in the same small pond. Which made things awkward at times.

I still wrote now and then, but stopped writing regularly for them when the ego stew started to boil over. In fact Todd and I had many idiotic passive aggresive conflicts based on not much more than petite issues such as him being a dellusional mental case and also me continually refusing his sexual advances despite. Should I also mention he was homophobic and would routinely harass people by shouting, “He’s gay!” And bullshit like that.

Anyway, Todd dragged me back to his office and started rambling incoherently about losing a Word document on hard drive and how he spent days writing and now he had nothing and maybe it was a sudden Word crash or something else and could I help him and he knew that if a file was deleted the data might still be on the hard disk and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah…

I nodded and waited for a pause in his rambling and then said, “Let me sit down and look.”

I sat down to look. It was one of those old dumpy all-in-one PowerMac G3 machines; not an iMac but just an awkward whale of a computer with a concave CRT monitor.

While I was poking around the system, Todd was kneeling next to me rambling on and on. I wanted to ask him to give me some space, but when Todd acted like this there was little that could be done to stop him.

Danny came into the writer’s room looking for Todd. “So we’re going to Nick’s. You coming?” And then Todd responded aggressively, “Jack needs to recover my file and then I can go.” Then he turned to look at me and blureted, “Do it Jack!” 

I dead-stared at him, looked at the computer and unplugged it.

“Why did you do that!” he screamed and I responded, “Your best bet at data recovery now is simply unplugging the machine, booting up with a data recover tool and hope fragments of the file are still around.”

“But why did you do that?!?!” He started to blurt at me; shaking all the while.

“Let me do this Todd,” I said as I walked past him, past Danny and back to the pile of software in the production office, found a data recovery CD-Rom and headed back into the writer’s office.

As I sat down, Danny and Todd were glowering at me. Neither one even saying one positive thing about these efforts. But at least they were quiet and not getting in the way of things.

After a few minutes of scanning the disk a few files popped up. One of them was the trashed file. It was not fully recoverable, but since it was a text file something of some sort could be pulled off the disk.

I found a floppy disk on Todd’s desk, stuck it in and saved what could.

Todd ran over to me all crazy eyed, grabbed the disk and said, “Give it to me!”

I phsyically pushed him back and said “Wait, Todd. I still need to do something.” And walked past him.

“What do you have to do Jack! What do you have to do Jack!” he shouted, standing in the hallway with Danny and some other writers and staff looking on.

“What’s happening?” one of my co-workers asked.

“Well, I managed to recover something from Todd’s mess but it’s not 100% good. Need to do some manual work,” I said.

He nodded, let me pass him and I sat down at my desk and worked on the file.

All I really had to do was open it up in a text editor save it in a text file and, et viola… Recovered data!

I mean, at least this damaged Word file was basically just a pile of text so it was easy enough to separate 70% text the text that was readable from the damaged data crazy character crap.

With that recovered data on a floppy disk I walked outside into the hallway, smiled and waved the floppy disk at Todd and said, “Not 100% but it’s something!”

***

Walked past him, straight into the writer’s office, popped the floppy into disk into the Todd’s computer, copied the file to his desktop, opened it up in Word and called him over.

As Todd sat down, I headed out into the hallway to talk to others.

After a while Todd screamed in joy, “You did! Jack did it!” and ran out into the hallway.

This was a great moment while it lasted as I basked in the idea that Todd could be respectful and nice for once. And in hot second a happy thing turned to garbage as Todd ran to me, broke past that personal space bubble we all had, grabbed me aggresively at the waist, grabbed the back of my head and tried to kiss me full open mouthed.

I pushed back and pushed back and shouted, “Todd! Todd! Todd!” It seemed to go on forever but had to be about 7 seconds in hell. As I struggled some people laughed while others shouted, “Todd, stop! Todd, stop!”

Nobody attempted to pull Todd off of me as we both slammed into the reception counter in the hallway, but after a while I managed to shove Todd away from me.

As he took a few steps back towards the entrance to the place, he was giddly smiling and giggling saying, “Thanks Jack! Thanks Jack!” repeatedly. Danny looked at us and said nothing as he held the door open for Todd to let him out
