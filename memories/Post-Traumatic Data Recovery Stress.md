## Post-Traumatic Data Recovery Stress

By Jack Szwergold

It was a spring or summerish day in the late 1990s. I would guess it was 1999 or so.

I was working my day at the wacky weekly newspaper place and found out a former staffer (Danny) was visiting.

Danny was a writer and editor in the pre-fame days of the wacky weekly newspaper when it was mainly a college focused beer and pizza rag with jokes to match. Nowadays the newspaper still thrived off of ad revenue from pizza and beer places but the content was far more sophisticated and focused to a national audience.

But that is no disrespect to Danny: He is the one who pioneered a more interesting kind of content in the publication and should be considered a founding editor moreso than others who have been given more credit than due in the publication’s later years.

But anyway, I’m digressing. Danny was visiting the publication again after leaving it in the context of a (justifable) rage quit a few years before.

I barely knew him, but others knew him and the visit was a big deal.

I said “Hello.” And he was fairly cold, “Oh, I know you…” he said in an aggresively passive aggresive way. There was a constant simmering hostility between old staff and new and there’s not much that could be done other than grin and bear it adn just let it pass.

He walked passed me, down the small hallway in the office and headed into the writer’s room where he was all smiles, laughs and warmly greeting old co-workers.
