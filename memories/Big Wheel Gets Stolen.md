## Big Wheel Gets Stolen
### About the Time Some Neighborhood Kids Stole My Big Wheel and How I Stole it Back

By Jack Szwergold

**Quick Notes**: About the time my Big Wheel was stolen when I was 11 years old by the twos kids of a neighborhood drug dealer and how I stole it back. They lived in a shack behind the house the old lady with overgrown lilacs lived in.

I was 10 or 11. Whatever the age, I was too old to ride my Big Wheel, but I still did.

Yeah, I might have caught myself in the reflection of the windows of Speedway drugs as I scooted around and looked slightly ridiculous, but I didn’t care. I liked riding my Big Wheel.

One weekend, I rode it around to the corner of Ocean Parkway and Brighton Beach Avenue when I ran into the neighborhood drug dealer and his kids. That makes it sound so ominous; “drug dealer.” And from my kids perspective he was definitely a drug dealer and a bookie. But he wasn’t any kinda big guy you wanted to rub the wrong way. He was just poor and a bit sketchy.

Anyway, his two kids saw me on my Big Wheel and cornered me. They wanted to ride it. At first I said “No…” but after a while I caved in and said yes. They were both smaller and younger than me so I don’t feel so bad.

So I got up, one of them got on to pedal it and the other stood up right behind him on the seat and they rode all the way down the block. Past my building, and other other buidings and down to where the private homes were and then down the driveway.

“Don’t worry!” their dad said, “They’ll bring it back.” So I walked back to the front of my building and played around with whatever kids were around.

After about an hour or so the sun was setting and the church bells were ringing and I was getting concerned. I walked down the block to see if I could see anything from their alley.

Then I ran into Howie and told him what happened. “Sounds like they stole it,” he said. Which I began to accept as the truth. At least the truth that existed in my 10 year old head at the time.

“So what can I do?” I asked Howie. He shrugged and didn’t know and neither did I. So I suggested we just walk to the house where their driveway was and then think it out.

The house was odd and somewhat “Haunted” but cool in that semi-abandoned sorta way. I know one half of the house—the right side—was either owned by or rented out to some Orthodox Jewish family because occassionally my mom would go there and I would tag along. The kids always looked pasty skinned and would react weirdly to some of the toys and things I would talk about.

The other side of the house was the weirder place.

The front yard was overgrown but oddly beautiful. Lots of lilacs and other flowers. You’d always hear sparrows chirping or see bees buzzing around the yard on any spring day. But all we knew about who owned it was that there was some old lady on the top floor who would flip out and start cursing gibberish if kids played near the driveway facing her windows. And if her crazy babbling old lady nonsense didn’t scare the kids away, she always seemed to have a bucket of water—at least I hope it was water—ready to toss on the kids to get the to leave the driveway.

Howie and I approached it carefully. The old lady’s corner window was opened up, but nowhere to be seen. Still, she was a risk to us kids. So we had to devise a plan.

A friend of Howie’s showed up as we were thinking up a plan. “What are you doing?” he asked. And we explained. After a while I devised the brilliant plan: The drug dealer and his kids lived in a shack or garage behind the house. One of us would have to run down the driveway, head to their shack, grab the Big Wheel and run back out.

“I’ll stay out here,” said Howie. And his friend agreed. So I guess I was the one who was going to run down the driveway.

“Well, you have to distract her from me when I run down there,” I said. And they nodded yeah, as they looked up. Suddenly the old lady appeared in the window and shouted “What are you doing?!?” as she looked at us.

I shrugged, and just darted down the driveway. She noticed thi and paniced and shouted “What!” as Howie and his friend tried to distract them from me.

I was 1/2 way down the alley in no time, and slowed down a bit. I could hear the old lady and Howie and his friend shout and scream behind me. I slowly approached the end of the driveway near the back of the house. And that’s when I saw it. The Big Wheel itself.

It was in good shape and sitting just outside of the swung open wooden door of the shack or garage the guy lived in. While nobody saw me sneaking up, to get the Big Wheel I definitely need to run somewhere in front of that open door.

So I calmed down, walked slowly towards the Big Wheel, got it by the handles, and barely peeked into the shack they all lived in. I saw the kids and I saw what looked like a sheet draped over a bed or couch.
