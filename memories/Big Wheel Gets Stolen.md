## Big Wheel Gets Stolen
### About the Time Some Neighborhood Kids Stole My Big Wheel and How I Stole it Back

By Jack Szwergold

I was 1978 or 1978 and I was 10 or 11 years old. A little bit vague on the exact year and age, but whatever the year was or my age was, I was definitely aware of the fact I was too old to ride my Big Wheel aorund the block. But I still did becuase I liked to do it.

Yeah, I might have caught myself in the reflection of the windows of Speedway Drugs as I scooted around and realized I looked slightly ridiculous, but I didn’t care. I liked riding that Big Wheel.

One weekend while riding it around the block, I rode it around to the corner of Ocean Parkway and Brighton Beach Avenue and ran into the neighborhood drug dealer and his kids. That description makes it sound so ominous; “drug dealer.” And from my perspective as a young kid, he was definitely a drug dealer and a bookie. But he wasn’t any kind of big deal guy doing shady stuff you wanted to rub the wrong way. He was just poor and kinda sketchy guy who did what he did to get by.

Anyway, his two kids saw me on my Big Wheel and cornered me right near subway entrace. They wanted to ride the Big Wheel and at first I said “No…” but after a few back and forth rounds, I caved in and said “Yes.” They were both smaller and younger than me so I didn’t feel like I was being bullied or anything like that.

So I stood up and got out of the seat and one of them immediately sat down to pedal it and the jumped on the back and stood up right behind as they rode that beat up Big Wheel all the way down the block. Past my building, past the other buildings and all the down to where the oddball private homes were and then they made a right down a driveway.

“Don’t worry!” their dad said, “They’ll bring it back.” So I walked back to the front of my building and played around with whatever kids were around.

After about an hour or so the sun was setting and the church bells were ringing and I was getting concerned. I walked down the block to see if I could see anything down the alley they went into.

As I walked donw the block, I ran into Howie and told him what happened. “Sounds like they stole it,” he said. Which I began to accept as the truth. At least the truth that existed in my 10 year old head at the time.

“So what can I do?” I asked Howie. He shrugged and didn’t know and neither did I. So I suggested we just walk to the house where their driveway was and then think it out.

The house was odd and somewhat “Haunted” but cool in that semi-abandoned sorta way. I know one half of the house—the right side—was either owned by or rented out to some Orthodox Jewish family because occasionally my mom would go there and I would tag along. The kids always looked pasty skinned and would react weirdly to some of the toys and things I would talk about.

The other side of the house was the weirder place.

The front yard was overgrown but oddly beautiful. Lots of lilacs and other flowers. You’d always hear sparrows chirping or see bees buzzing around the yard on any spring day. But all we knew about who owned it was that there was some old lady on the top floor who would flip out and start cursing gibberish if kids played near the driveway facing her windows. And if her crazy babbling old lady nonsense didn’t scare the kids away, she always seemed to have a bucket of water—at least I hope it was water—ready to toss on the kids to get the to leave the driveway.

Howie and I approached it carefully. The old lady’s corner window was opened up, but nowhere to be seen. Still, she was a risk to us kids. So we had to devise a plan.

A friend of Howie’s showed up as we were thinking up a plan. “What are you doing?” he asked. And we explained. After a while I devised the brilliant plan: The drug dealer and his kids lived in a shack or garage behind the house. One of us would have to run down the driveway, head to their shack, grab the Big Wheel and run back out.

“I’ll stay out here,” said Howie. And his friend agreed. So I guess I was the one who was going to run down the driveway.

“Well, you have to distract her from me when I run down there,” I said. And they nodded yeah, as they looked up. Suddenly the old lady appeared in the window and shouted “What are you doing?!?” as she looked at us.

I shrugged, and just darted down the driveway. She noticed this and panicked and shouted “What!” as Howie and his friend tried to distract them from me.

I was 1/2 way down the alley in no time, and slowed down a bit. I could hear the old lady and Howie and his friend shout and scream behind me. I slowly approached the end of the driveway near the back of the house. And that’s when I saw it. The Big Wheel itself.

It was in good shape and sitting just outside of the swung open wooden door of the shack or garage the guy lived in. While nobody saw me sneaking up, to get the Big Wheel I definitely need to run somewhere in front of that open door.

So I calmed down, walked slowly towards the Big Wheel, got it by the handles, and barely peeked into the shack they all lived in. I saw the kids and I saw what looked like a sheet draped over a bed or couch. The second I grabbed the Big Wheel, the kids turned around and saw me and shouted “Hey!” so I stopped rolling it and picked it up by the front handles and started running back down the alley.

I could still hear the kids shouting behind me, but was more worried about what was in front of me: That screaming old lady. Howie and his friend saw me and shouted at me, “Okay! Come on!” and all that.

The old lady turned around to see me running down the driveway and just exclaimed, “Oh!” paused and then we knew what was coming next: A bucket full of water or whatever.

I ran harder with the drug dealers kids behind me trying to catch up. Just as I got past the area just beneath the old lady’s window, I could here the sound of a bucket being dumped. But it missed me.

It crashed on the ground in the alley and stopped the drug dealer’s kids in their tracks. Once I got to the sidewalk, I high fived Howie and his friend and we all started to make a beeline down the block. By then a few older people and adults came around to see what was happening.

I got onto the Big Wheel and pedaled it back to my building. I waved back to Howie and his friend as I passed their building and headed back to my building deeper down the block.

My dad was in front of the building sitting in a folding chair and asked, “What happened?” and I looked at him and said “Nothing!” as I got off of the Big Wheel, rolled it to the lobby of the building and got my mom to buzz me in.
