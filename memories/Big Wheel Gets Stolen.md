## Big Wheel Gets Stolen
### About the Time Some Neighborhood Kids Stole My Big Wheel and How I Stole it Back

By Jack Szwergold

**Quick Notes**: About the time my Big Wheel was stolen when I was 11 years old by the twos kids of a neighborhood drug dealer and how I stole it back. They lived in a shack behind the house the old lady with overgrown lilacs lived in.

I was 10 or 11. Whatever the age, I was too old to ride my Big Wheel, but I still did.

Yeah, I might have caught myself in the reflection of the windows of Speedway drugs as I scooted around and looked slightly ridiculous, but I didn’t care. I liked riding my Big Wheel.

One weekend, I rode it around to the corner of Ocean Parkway and Brighton Beach Avenue when I ran into the neighborhood drug dealer and his kids. That makes it sound so ominous; “drug dealer.” And from my kids perspective he was definitely a drug dealer and a bookie. But he wasn’t any kinda big guy you wanted to rub the wrong way. He was just poor and a bit sketchy.

Anyway, his two kids saw me on my Big Wheel and cornered me. They wanted to ride it. At first I said “No…” but after a while I caved in and said yes. They were both smaller and younger than me so I don’t feel so bad.

So I got up, one of them got on to pedal it and the other stood up right behind him on the seat and they rode all the way down the block. Past my building, and other other buidings and down to where the private homes were and then down the driveway.

“Don’t worry!” their dad said, “They’ll bring it back.” So I walked back to the front of my building and played around with whatever kids were around.
