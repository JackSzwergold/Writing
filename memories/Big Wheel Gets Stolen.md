## Big Wheel Gets Stolen
### About the Time Some Neighborhood Kids Stole My Big Wheel and How I Stole it Back

By Jack Szwergold

I was 1978 or 1978 and I was 10 or 11 years old. A little bit vague on the exact year and age, but whatever the year was or my age was, I was definitely aware of the fact I was too old to ride my Big Wheel around the block. But I still did because I liked to do it.

Yeah, I might have caught myself in the reflection of the windows of Speedway Drugs as I scooted around and realized I looked slightly ridiculous, but I didn’t care. I liked riding that Big Wheel.

One weekend while riding it around the block, I rode it around to the corner of Ocean Parkway and Brighton Beach Avenue and ran into the neighborhood drug dealer and his kids. That description makes it sound so ominous; “drug dealer.” And from my perspective as a young kid, he was definitely a drug dealer and a bookie. But he wasn’t any kind of big deal guy doing shady stuff you wanted to rub the wrong way. He was just poor and kinda sketchy guy who did what he did to get by.

Anyway, his two kids saw me on my Big Wheel and cornered me right near subway entrance. They wanted to ride the Big Wheel and at first I said “No…” but after a few back and forth rounds, I caved in and said “Yes.” They were both smaller and younger than me so I didn’t feel like I was being bullied or anything like that.

So I stood up and got out of the seat and one of them immediately sat down to pedal it and the jumped on the back and stood up right behind as they rode that beat up Big Wheel all the way down the block. Past my building, past the other buildings and all the down to where the oddball private homes were and then they made a right down a driveway.

“Don’t worry!” their dad said, “They’ll bring it back.” So I walked back to the front of my building and played around with whatever kids were around.

After about an hour or so the sun was setting and the church bells were ringing and I was getting concerned. I walked down the block to see if I could see anything down the alley they went into.

As I walked down the block, I ran into Howie and told him what happened. “Sounds like they stole it,” he said pretty matter-of-factly. Which when I heard those words said out loud, I began to accept as the truth. At least the truth that existed in my young kid’s head at the time.

“So what can I do?” I asked Howie. He shrugged and didn’t know and neither did I. So I suggested we just walk to the house where their driveway was and think it out.

The house was odd and had a somewhat “haunted”—but cool—look about it in that semi-abandoned house sorta way. I knew that one half of the house—the right side—was either owned by or rented out to some Orthodox Jewish family because occasionally my mom would go there and I would tag along. Those Orthodox kids always looked pasty skinned and would react weirdly to some of the toys and things I would talk about.

The other side of the house was the really weirder part of the equation.

The front yard was overgrown but oddly beautiful. Lots of lilacs and other flowers. You’d always hear sparrows chirping or see bees buzzing around the yard on any spring day. But all we knew about who owned it was that there was some old lady on the top floor who would flip out and start shouting gibberish sprinkled with curses if kids played near the driveway facing her windows. And if her crazy babbling old lady nonsense didn’t scare the kids away, she always seemed to have a bucket of water—at least we all hoped it was water—ready to toss on the kids to get them to leave the driveway.

So knowing that, Howie and I approached that driveway as carefully as we could. The old lady’s corner window was opened up, but she was nowhere to be seen. Still, she was a risk to us kids. So we had to devise a plan.

A friend of Howie’s showed up as we were thinking up a plan. “What are you doing?” he asked and we explained the whole situation to him. After a while I devised a brilliant plan: The drug dealer and his kids lived in some kind of shack—or modified garage—behind the house. One of us would run down the driveway, head to their shack, grab the Big Wheel and run back out.

“I’ll stay out here,” said Howie. And his friend agreed. So I guess I was the one who was going to run down the driveway.

“Well, you guys have to distract her from me when I run down there,” I said. And they nodded in agreement when they suddenly looked up: The old lady appeared in the window and started shouting at us as she looked at us.

Seeing that I just shrugged, and just ran straight down the driveway. She noticed me and panicked and shouted a very clear “What!?!” as Howie and his friend tried to distract her from me.

I was more than half way down the alley in no time, and slowed down a bit. I could hear the old lady and Howie and his friend shout and scream behind me, but that wasn’t my concern at that moment. As I moved close to the way and slowly walked down the last few steps of the driveway, that’s when I saw it: The Big Wheel itself.

It was in good shape and sitting just outside of the swung open wooden door of the shack they all lived in. While nobody—except that old lady—saw me sneaking up, to get the Big Wheel I needed to basically run in front of that open door, grab it and get out.

So I took a few deep breaths, walked slowly towards the Big Wheel, grabbed it by the handles, and quickly peeked into the shack they all lived in as I pushed it towards the driveway. I could see the kids and I saw what looked like a sheet draped over a bed or couch. The kids didn’t initially notice me, but the second I grabbed the Big Wheel, the kids turned around, saw me and shouted “Hey!” so I stopped rolling it and picked it up by the front fork and started running back down the alley.

I could hear the kids shouting as they chased after me, but was more worried about what was in front of me: That screaming old lady. Howie and his friend saw me and shouted at me, “Okay! Come on!” and all that.

The old lady turned her head to see me running down the driveway and just exclaimed, “Oh!?!” paused, ducked inside and then we knew that  bucket full of water or whatever the hell she had was going to come flying out that window at any moment.

Knowing that, I ran harder with the kids behind me trying to catch up. Just as I got past the area beneath the old lady’s window, I could hear the sound of a bucket of liquid being dumped. It smacked straight onto the ground behind me and thankfully missed me. But the splash did manage to stop those kids right in their tracks.

Once I got to the sidewalk, I high fived Howie and his friend and we all started to make a beeline down the block. By then a few older people and other miscellaneous adults came around to see what the commotion was about.

With the coast being pretty much clear, I got onto the Big Wheel, waved back to Howie and his friend and just rode it straight back to my building.  

My dad was in front of the building sitting in a folding chair and asked, “What happened?” and I looked at him and said “Nothing!” as I got off of the Big Wheel, rolled it to the lobby of the building and got my mom to buzz me in.
