## Big Wheel Gets Stolen
### About the Time Some Neighborhood Kids Stole My Big Wheel and How I Stole it Back

By Jack Szwergold

**Quick Notes**: About the time my Big Wheel was stolen when I was 11 years old by the twos kids of a neighborhood drug dealer and how I stole it back. They lived in a shack behind the house the old lady with overgrown lilacs lived in.

I was 10 or 11. Whatever the age, I was too old to ride my Big Wheel, but I still did.

Yeah, I might have caught myself in the reflection of the windows of Speedway drugs as I scooted around and looked slightly ridiculous, but I didn’t care. I liked riding my Big Wheel.

One weekend, I rode it around to the corner of Ocean Parkway and Brighton Beach Avenue when I ran into the neighborhood drug dealer and his kids. That makes it sound so ominous; “drug dealer.” And from my kids perspective he was definitely a drug dealer and a bookie. But he wasn’t any kinda bug guy you wanted to rub the wrong way.
