I utterly hated college. Brooklyn College sucked. I should have never have went. But occassional stops at Silver Star Comics was a lifeline. But it was only a superficial balm. I would obsessively buy comics — and try to find bargains — but I barely read or remembered any of them. I was simply trying to relieve the thrill of rumaging through old comics at Nostrand Books on Brighton Beach Avenue in elemetaerty school but now as a young adult in college.

A junky huge store I went to to mainly get old back issues of Antic and SoftSide magazine. Was kind of like a junkier, Brooklyn version of Ruby’s books on Chamber’s Street.

Cool crammed place. Staff up on a high counter. I scored a copy of Reid Fleming’s “Flaming Carrot” #1 and other 1980s idependent oddballs. I also remember they oddly had copies of some hardcover books on the rock band “Blackfoot.”

This was a revelation and inspired me to take long walks from my home at Ocean Parkway and Brighton Beach Avenue to Coney Island Avenue and Avenue X where Comtek was located. I don’t know how I found out about it, but it had a few gigantic posters for Atari 2600 games like “Defender“ and “Space Invaders” so I could have spotted it from the B68 bus.

The inside was a small shop that was carpeted and had wood paneling. It was somewhat dark with mainly the glow of computer and video setups lighting up the place. They sold and repaired computers but video equipment as well. One thing memorable was the giant poster for Marilyn Chambers’ infamous 1980 porn flick “Insatiable” that hung near the entrace. I never found Marilyn Chambers that attractive, but as a 12 year old boy my jaw slightly hung in amazement that this place was an official Atari retailer and they sold porn videos as well.
