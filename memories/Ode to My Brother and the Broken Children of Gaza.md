# Ode to My Brother and the Broken Children of Gaza
## Thoughts on My Brother on the 6th Month of the Isreal Hamas War

Written on March 1, 2023

Been trying to find the words to explain this, but my brother — who is 20 years older than me — is death obsessed lunatic. I’m starting to think many “born again” religious Jews are apocalyptic lunatics as well.

We, the Jews — according to them — are better than everybody else. We don’t make mistakes. We are an utterly flawless people that are better than the goyim. Our actual shit literary never stinks!

Could us Jews be more delusional? As if God granted us alone humanity in this world and everyone else is just less than rather than equal to?

My brother, the born again Jewish loon, admires Chabbad Rabbe Menachem Schneerson, Nazi Propagandist Leni Reifenstahl, Dog Owner Richard Nixon and Watercolorist Adolf Hitler.

Yes, seriously. You only learn this the closer you get to him; he peels back the layers of his facade to reveal his dark core.

Despite our family being literally massacred by Nazis he admires Hitler. He sees no problem with German Nationalism. He only takes issue with Jews being targeted. Other than that? He sees Hitler as a good strong leader. And what’s so bad about that?

Did I tell you he admires Adolf Hitler?

When I was a kid and collected stamps, he thought it appropriate to share his stamp collection: Predominantly Hitler and Nazi stamps with the occasional flag or flower. I guess they still used them in post-World War II Poland; I mean they were good stamps. Utterly ruined any joy I found in my childhood hobby. This asshole shoving his childhood trauma in stamp form into my little kid Brooklyn life. 

Last I dealt with him in 2005 or so, he routinely defended the Confederacy and blurted out bile against “Black People!” Literally for no reason, he’ll just shout, “Black People!” while driving. How many times was I with him in whatever car he drove and I think he would lose his mind and swerve the car in highway speed traffic.

I’d hopefully be able to crawl out of the wreckage if I was still alive. And finally
be relieved: He was finally dead. His lifelong dream achieved! The bully was finally dead! And I was the walking wounded sitting on a traffic barrier waiting for the cops to show up. Scuffed up but able to breathe again.

I don’t know what he thinks about what’s going on in Gaza, but I’m sure it’s utterly horrible. I am not even curious to what he thinks. I just know that if his son or daughter were in the IDF it would be his wet dream to see them kill an Arab. And he would kvell with joy if they, themselves were killed. Yeah, I said that. To see his children shed their blood for Israel would be his ultimate joy; he could have a life of joyful mourning for his martyred children.

Did I just use the word “martyred?” Yup. He has a blood lust. He would see more value in their deaths than their lives; he can go to talks and speak on the news because of their deaths. Their deaths would bring more pragmatic meaning to his life.

Truly, I don’t wish them death. They’re technically my nephew and niece; but no adult relationship worth talking about. But they deserve life.

But I’m just outlining the lunacy of their own father; my brother. They never rebelled against their father; my brother. They had no reason to.

He could never see the same sad and tragic aspects of his broken childhood in the broken childhoods of the children of Gaza. He could never emphasize with their struggle and their pain.

But he could shout, scream and act out violently when I knew him. I’m glad I don’t know him anymore. Come to think of it? I never knew him.
