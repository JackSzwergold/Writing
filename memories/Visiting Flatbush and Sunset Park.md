# Visiting Flatbush and Sunset Park

**Quick Notes**: Getting into a fight with my parents, my dad calls my sister, my sister’s husband drives over to talk to me. I get into his Chevy Malibu, he says some bullshit and then drives to pick up his brother. Before you know it we are driving around looking for drugs. First near Flatbush (Prospect-Lefferts Gardens). We stopped in a bagel place near the hospital that’s there. Then we drove to Sunset Park. Around 8th Avenue and 60th Street. Some very busty hispanic woman with bottle blonde hair comes out, talks too my sister’s husband, walks back to some building near the train tracks and then comes back. They smoke up, but never offer it to me. I was there as a bit of insurance; nobody wants trouble when a kid is in the car. Even if that kid is 15 to 16 years old.
