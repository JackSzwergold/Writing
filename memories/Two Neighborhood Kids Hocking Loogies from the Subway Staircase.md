## Two Neighborhood Kids Hocking Loogies from the Subway Staircase
### About the Time I Spotted Two Sorta Friends Hocking Loogies from the Staircase of the Subway Station from My the Window of My Room 

By Jack Szwergold

I don’t know if it was a Saturday, a Sunday or a holiday, but I remember it being Fall-ish kind of afternoon—but it could have still been Spring for all I remember—and I was sitting at my desk in my room not doing anything much but playing around with stuff and occasionally looking out the window.

I liked watching the trains pass by and the clouds passing by as well. Occasionally a Coast Guard or an NYPD helicopter would pass by low and that would be cool too. The normal ebb and flow of urban shore life I guess.

Whatever the backdrop of my day was, I was basically sitting around, slacking off and not doing much of anything when I saw two kids around my age hanging out around the subway staircase. They were leaning over, hocking loogies and hoping to hit some hapless passerby on the head with their globs of spit as they walked down the street.

They were mostly just standing there bent over the guard rails on the staircase and looking down for a ripe target to hit so I didn’t immediately know who they were. But when one of them stood up straight and spotted me in my window and waved at me—and I could finally see one of their faces—I knew who they were. It was one of two neighborhood kids I knew who lived across the street in Trump Village; Andrew or Marc. And I knew it was either Andrew or Marc because where ever Andrew went, Marc went… And vice-versa.

I wasn’t really good friends with either of them, but I knew them because my sister was friends with Andrew’s sister Michelle. And sometime’s my sister’s main form of babysitting was basically just telling me to play with Michelle’s brother.

Anyway, like I saw we weren’t exactly friends. But we weren’t exactly enemies either. In retrospect, they were bullies and—being merely a 10 year old child of immigrants at the time—I didn’t know much better but to think their “bullying” was just a byproduct of the cultural differences I would eventually learn to understand. I rationalized it then as a child, but realize what they are now: Just bullies at best.

Andrew waved over to me and shouted that I should come over to hang out them. My dad heard this and asked me what was up. I pointed to them and said, “I’m going over to play with them.” He looked at me and looked at them and tentatively approved. My dad wasn’t too hot about Andrew and Marc but was open-minded enough to know that if I wanted to be with them, he wouldn’t stand in the way.

So off I went down the stairs, outside the building, down the block and up the subway staircase to hang out with Andrew and Marc.

I said “Hi!” and they said “Hi!” and then they git back to their task at hand: Hocking loogies on the heads of hapless victims walking down the street below.

I looked over the rail with them and watched as they carefully timed their spits, but I never participated in the whole thing. It all seemed disgusting and stupid. But somehow I was there enabling them in my on small way.

After a few failed shots, one of them hit someone smack in the head and you could hear the hapless guy shout and threaten to “get us” so we ran through across the way to the other side of the train station entrance.

Not as many people walked down the avenue on the other side of the station, so it seemed like the “loogie hocking” game was for all intents and purposes over… At least for now.

Bored and idle—but still having some free time on our hands—we all tried to figure out what to do next.

“Let’s go to ‘Youth World’!” I said to which Marc and Andrew responded with a hesitant, “Okay…” so down the stairs we went.

Once we were down the stairs and on the street below we took a few steps in front of supermarket until we hit that weird alley that was technically Brighton 1st Street, but was called Beach Walk or some nonsense like that. There was no car traffic but lots of asphalt covered walking space, with weeds growing out of the cracks and random pieces of garbage here and there. It wasn’t clean nor was it garbage strewn but it was like vacant lot that was formally defined as a street by someone at some point in NYC history and left as that.

As we stood near Beach Walk, Marc poked Andrew in the arm, and motioned towards the Brighton Towers co-ops. The buildings were a newish pair of co-op buildings that seemed nicer than the tenements most of us grew up in, but were dumpy in their own mid-century modern kind of way. Accessing them from Beach Walk was a simple run up a fire escape staircase away.

“Hey Jack! Let’s go there!” Andrew said as he pointed to the Brighton Towers.

“What are we going to do there?” I asked and without hesitation, Andrew said, “Don’t worry. It’ll be fun.”

With that settled we all walked down that alley and up that fire escape staircase up one flight. The building and that staircase was weird as if it were built as a tiered wedding cake with one huge layer of a parking lot on the ground floor and two towers jutting out above it.

So we climbed up those stairs and soon enough were wandering on a weird kind of lower-level roof with terraces jutting out around each of the towers. Accessing the lower level windows and terraces was ridiculously easy.

“What are we doing?” I asked as Andrew and Marc stooped down and—like soldiers on a mission—peered into random open windows and terraces as we all walked around.

“Let’s try this one?” Marc said as Andrew climbed over the terrace railing and slowly tried to slide open the aluminum screen door.

“Why are you doing that?” I asked as the screen door slowly slid open. Marc joined Andrew and both quietly laughed as they looked at me and looked inside the apartment.

“Come on in Jack… Don’t worry.” Andrew whispered with a muffled giggle as he stood inside the terrace entrance. I shook my head from left to right as if to say “No…” in that slow, subtle, subconscious way that you shake your head when you don’t realize you are saying “No…” and slowly backed away from the terrace.

As I backed away I veered to the side to take a peek into the window they just peered into.

The window was open and the screen was down. A white curtain fluttered a bit in the breeze. I couldn’t see much, but all I could see was a woman seemingly asleep on a bed, and the shadows of what I assume were Andrew and Marc coming down a hallway near the room.

I backed away from the window, jogged down the fire escape staircase, ran down Beach Walk and sprinted across Brighton Beach Avenue to head back home.
