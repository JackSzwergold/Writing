## Two Neighborhood Kids Hocking Loogies from the Subway Staircase
### About the Time I Spotted Two Sorta Friends Hocking Loogies from the Staircase of the Subway Station from My the Window of My Room 

By Jack Szwergold

I don’t know if it was a Saturday, a Sunday or a holiday, but I remember it being Fall-ish—but it could have still been Spring—and I was sitting around on my desk in my room playing around with stuff and occassionally looking out the window.

I liked watching the trains pass by and the clouds up in the sky and sometimes the occassional Coast Guard or NYPD helicopter pass by.

Regardless, I was sitting around and slacking off when I saw two kids hanging out on the subway staircase. They were leaning over and hocking loogies hoping to hit some hapless passerby on the head as they walked down the street.

They were mostly bent over and looking down but one of them stood up straight and spotted me in my window. It was Andrew or Marc; two neighborhood kids who lived in Trump Village but I knew because my sister was friends with Andrew’s sister Michelle.

We weren’t exactly friends, but we weren’t exactly enemies either. In retrospect, they were bullies and—being merely a 10 year old at the time—didn’t know much better.

Andrew waved over to me and shouted that I should come over to them. My dad heard this and asked me what was up. I pointed to them and said, “I’m going over to play with them.” He looked at me and looked at them and tentatively approved. My dad wasn’t too hot about Andrew and Marc but was open-minded enough to know that if I wanted to be with them, he wouldn’t stand in the way.

So off I went outside, down the block, up the staircase to hang out with Andrew and Marc.

They said “Hi” and then go back to the task at hand: Hocking loogies on the heads of people walking down the street below.

I looked over with them and watched as they carefully timed theirn spits, but I never participated in the whole thing. It all seemed digusting and stupid.

Soon enough one of them hit someone and you could hear them shout and threaten to “get us” so we ran through the train station onto the other side.

Not as many people walked down that side of the avenue, so it seemed like the game was over… At least for now.

Bored and baffled—but still having time on our hands—we tried to figure out what to do next.

“Let’s go to ‘Youth World’!” I said
