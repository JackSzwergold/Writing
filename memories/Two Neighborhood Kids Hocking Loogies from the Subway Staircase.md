## Two Neighborhood Kids Hocking Loogies from the Subway Staircase
### About the Time I Spotted Two Sorta Friends Hocking Loogies from the Staircase of the Subway Station from My the Window of My Room 

By Jack Szwergold

I don’t know if it was a Saturday, a Sunday or a holiday, but I remember it being Fall-ish kind of day—but it could have still been Spring for all I remember—and I was sitting at my desk in my room not doing anything much but playing around with stuff and occasionally looking out the window.

I liked watching the trains pass by and the clouds passing by as well. Occasionally a Coast Guard or an NYPD helicopter would pass by low and that would be cool too. The normal ebb and flow of urban shore life I guess.

Whatever the backdrop of my day was, I was basically sitting around, slacking off and not doing much of anything when I saw two kids around my age hanging out around the subway staircase. They were leaning over, hocking loogies and hoping to hit some hapless passerby on the head with their globs of spit as they walked down the street.

They were mostly just standing there bent over the guard rails on the staircase and looking down for a ripe target to hit so I didn’t immediately know who they were. But when one of them stood up straight and spotted me in my window and waved at me—and I could finally see one of their faces—I knew who they were. It was one of two neighborhood kids I knew who lived across the street in Trump Village; Andrew or Marc. And I knew it was either Andrew or Marc because where ever Andrew went, Marc went… And vice-versa.

I wasn’t really good friends with either of them, but I knew them because my sister was friends with Andrew’s sister Michelle. And sometime’s my sister’s main form of babysitting was basically just telling me to play with Michelle’s brother.

Anyway, like I saw we weren’t exactly friends. But we weren’t exactly enemies either. In retrospect, they were bullies and—being merely a 10 year old child of immigrants at the time—I didn’t know much better but to think their “bullying” was just a byproduct of the cultural differences I would eventually learn to understand. I rationalized it then as a child, but realize what they are now: Just bullies at best.

Andrew waved over to me and shouted that I should come over to hang out them. My dad heard this and asked me what was up. I pointed to them and said, “I’m going over to play with them.” He looked at me and looked at them and tentatively approved. My dad wasn’t too hot about Andrew and Marc but was open-minded enough to know that if I wanted to be with them, he wouldn’t stand in the way.

So off I went down the stairs, outside the building, down the block and up the subway staircase to hang out with Andrew and Marc.

They said “Hi” and then go back to the task at hand: Hocking loogies on the heads of people walking down the street below.

I looked over with them and watched as they carefully timed their spits, but I never participated in the whole thing. It all seemed disgusting and stupid.

Soon enough one of them hit someone and you could hear them shout and threaten to “get us” so we ran through the train station onto the other side.

Not as many people walked down that side of the avenue, so it seemed like the game was over… At least for now.

Bored and baffled—but still having time on our hands—we tried to figure out what to do next.

“Let’s go to ‘Youth World’!” I said to which Marc and Andrew responded with a hesitant, “Okay…” so down the stairs we went.

Once we were downstairs we all took a few steps until we hit the weird alley that was technically Brighton 1st Street, but literally Beach Walk or some nonsense like that.

Marc poked Andrew in the arm, and motioned towards the Brighton Towers. They were a newish co-op building that seemed nicer than the tenements most of us grew up in, but were dumpy in their own way.

“Hey Jack! Let’s go there!” Andrew said as he pointed to the Brighton Towers.

“What are we going to do there?” I asked to which Andrew responded, “Don’t worry. It will be fun.”

We walked down that alley and up a staircase. The building was weird as if it were built as a tiered wedding cake with one huge layer on the ground floor and two towers jutting out above it.

So we climbed up those stairs and soon enough were wandering on a weird non-roof with terraces jutting out around each of the towers.

“What are we doing?” I asked as Andrew and Marc stooped down and peered into open windows.

“Let’s try this one?” Marc said as Andrew climbed over the terrace fence and slowly tried to slide open a screen door.

“Why are you doing that?” I asked as the screen door cracked open, Marc joined Andrew and both laughed creepily as they looked at me and looked inside.

“Come on in Jack. Don’t worry.” Andrew whispered as I slowly backed off, but veered to the side to look into the window they peered into.

The window was open and the screen was down. A white curtain fluttered a bit in the sea shore breeze. All I could see was a woman sleeping on a bed, and the shadows of what I assume were Andrew and Marc coming down a hallway near the room.

I backed away, and walked back towards the ladder, down onto the street and jaywalked in a sprint back to my home.
