## Atari 400 Bullshit (Part 1)
### Title says it all.

By Jack Szwergold

It was 1980, I was 12 years old going on 13, and old enough to head off into Junior High School and boy oh boy, was I obsessed with video games. *Space Invaders*, *GORF* and *Bite Monster* were my favorites because they were the only video games I had access to in the scratch and dent storefronts in Brighton Beach.

Never heard of *Bite Monster*? Don’t worry… Most people didn’t. *Bite Monster* was the name of some bootleg German version of *Pac-Man* the local candy store—“40 Thieves”—had. And I really liked playing *Bite-Monster*.

Anyway, I was really into video games at the time. But I also loved going to the arcades in Coney Island and playing some of the old school pinball and electromagnetic games they still had there: Horse racing games, target shooting games, baseball games… But as much fun as they were, they were inherently limited by physical space.

The playing field on an electromagnetic game was just what you saw in front of you. It as basically like you were playing some game in a tiny diorama. Oh, sometimes it was cool and fun in it’s own kitschy way, but each game only had limited, physical world appeal.

A video game’s scope—on the other hand—was essentially limitless since the playing field of a video game was just this flat digital canvas filled with pixels. And that grid of pixels could be tweaked, twisted and controlled to create tons of different worlds, fantasies and realms.

A game like *Pac-Man* could not exist in any other medium.

Anyway, I loved video games and was obsessed with having a video game system at home. And at the time the premier video game system was the classic Atari 2600. Clunky graphics aside, Atari games were fun since—while they might have not had the rich graphics and details of their arcade counterparts—they were far and away more interesting to play and look at than some of the TV game systems at the time. “TV game” systems at the time only let you play games such as “skeet shoot” or some crappy version of pong or something and not much else.



Anyway, it was 1980, I was 12 years old going on 13, and old enough to head off into Junior High School. And for a Jewish kid that meant a Bar Mitzvah. My family was never religious or faithful—and neither was I—but I went to afternoon Hebrew school at the time since everyone did. And through that limited education I learned the most important thing a Jewish kid could learn about their Bar Mitzvah: Chances were good that family members and others might potentially come out of nowhere to toss gifts of cash and expensive gifts at you for no other reason than you were somehow a “man” at the age of 13.

Like most kids on the edge of adolescence, I was a naive and delusional. This was despite the fact that it was obvious my parents were unquestionaly poor and my extended family treated my family—and me—like utter garbage. Yet depsite all of that, I had some grand fantasy that somehow on the wonderful occassion of my 13th birthday, all of those differences would somehow be put aside and somehow my extended family would find it in their hearts to bestow that time honored tradition of giving a 13 year old kid expensive gifts or piles of cash.

So as the date approached I started to flip through the Sunday newspaper advertisements with a focused intent and goal in mind: May’s, Topp’s, Macy’s, A&S and Korvette’s… Which of these low-brow to mid-brow discount chains would give me the best deal—and most convincing economic argument—that I could use to persuade the adults in my life to toss their well intentioned Bar Mitzvah cash towards me so I could finally play video games at home.

One Saturday night, after my dad picked up the Sunday Daily News, I rummaged through the non-news detritus on the living room table. And there between the “Parade Magazine” and the Sunday comics was a sight to be seen: Two digitally rendered dinosaurs facing off to fight each other in some digital landscape on the cover of the current Radio Shack discount supplement.

I held onto that supplement with obsessesive intented and soaked up all the details: The game was called “Dino Wars” and if I wanted to play it I needed to own a TRS-80 color computer. Just those words, “Color Computer” screamed humblebrag to me: “Other computers might be computers, but this computer was in full color!” But in all seriousness it was a big deal at the time since most “TV games” at the time were simply black and white affairs… Even when you used a color TV with them.

So the idea of a “Color Computer” boggled my mind. And better yet… There was a Radio Shack right nearby us in the Trump Village shopping center. I imagined myself owning a TRS-80 and wandering into the store on the weekend to get the inside scoop on hot new TRS-80 games before anybody else knew.

While those dreams floated in my head, the most tangible reality of them I could hold onto was that Radio Shack supplent. And I carefully kept that supplement in my desk drawer to look at and reference every now and then.

One weekend a few weeks later—as I was daydreaming on the floor of my room with some toys, comics and that supplement near me—my brother showed up seemingly out of nowhere.

He was acting odd… Almost strange… There was no shouting or fighting as he walked into my room—which was strange for him—kneeled down and started to talk to me in some patronizing sing-songy voice.

“What are you reading?” he asked.

I said “This!” and showed him what I was reading: It was the Radio Shack supplement with the two dinosaurs fighting on the cover of it.

“Do you want to play this game?” he asked.

I nodded, “Yes…” as I started to explain what the game was and what a Radio Shack TRS-80 color computer was.

“That’s very nice,” he said. “Maybe you can get that for your Bar Mitzvah!” he added.

I nodded, but was confused. While my brother wasn’t mean all the time, the kind of niceness he was was expressing during this interaction was smewhat creepy. His tone of voice sounded a bit off as well; as if he was forcing himself to be nice in that way that people who weren’t nice did when they tried to be nice.

But I accepted it for what it was worth and soon he was gone.

A few months later—in June—my Bar Mitzvah came and it happened and that is the absolute best that can be said about. My family wasn’t religious so the actual Bar Mitzvah itself was cursory “paint by numbers” exercise at best rather than anything memorable. In retrospect that Bar Mitzvah should not have ever have happened and maybe a basic birthday party with some pizza and ice cream would have been a more honest reflection of who I was and how my family approached religious affairs at the time.

After the somewhat awkward ceremony at the Synagogue on Brighton 4th Stree, we headed bakc to the family home on Ocean Parkway. I saw gift boxes on the table in the living room and as ready to go at them.

So after accepting cards and kisses on the cheek from relatives, I started to rip those boxes open. Soon enough I saw the word “Atari” on the side of silver box. I removed more wrapping and saw it right in front of me: “Atari 400 Personal Computer.” What?

As I looked at the box and read the writing on it, some relatives gasped and started to gab and my brother focused on explaining what the computer was.

“This is better than a video game system!” he said. “With this you can make your own games!” he added.

I wasn’t exactly dejected; I mean programming your own games is fine but I guess I need to play some games to begin with. Espcially since I had no idea how to program anything at the time.

“Are there any games?” I bluntly asked, and then and there my brother revealed a small pile of software. “Star Raiders” and “Life” and a small cassette tape that said “Space Invaders” on it. I didn’t understand how that tape worked so my brother showed me.

He took the cassette tape, stuck it into an odd looking Atari 410 tape deck that sat next to the computer and loaded it. For seemingly an eternity there was a blank blue screen on the TV set with the steady drone of a beep coming through the speaker. How thrilling.

Soon enough the words “Space Invaders” showed up on the screen. But what I was looking at did not look like the “Space Invaders” arcade game I played at “40 Thieves.” Regardless, I grabbed a joystick and played. It was fun, but different.

Next up was *Star Raiders* which was something else. It was a first person start fighter simulator and while it took some reading and learning to understand how it worked, it was a fun first person perspective space game.

“And you know, when we finally get you the BASIC cartridge, you can make your own games,” my brother said.

I played these games and enjoyed them, but something felt wrong. While I technically enjoyed the games, it still felt weird I would own something like this.

At that age I didn’t want a computer. I just wanted to play video games. Who else in my neighborhood had a computer? We were all poor. This was all odd.
