Supporting this guy’s family experience during World War II with a summary of my mom’s experience: Her who teenage experience — ages 13 to 18 — was running away from Nazis and sympathizers.

September 1938, my mom is 13 years old. Youngest of 8 kids. Spent her days playing with the family farm animals then was rounded up and put in a cattle car headed to some murder factory.

Knowing whatever the destination for the train car would be was not a good one, she decides to jump off the moving train. She did it but twisted her ankle. Despite that she quickly limped into the woods.

Thankfully whatever teenage dipshit Nazi guard on the train didn’t shoot her. Anyway, at some point she finds an older sister. They survive on the run. They never shared what they did to survive. Teenage girls in war? I can’t even imagine their personal hell.

At some point my mom meets up with an Uncle. He helps them but when they leave, he gives my mom the deed to his property. She held onto it until the war ended in 1945. That is when she met my father, a Polish (Western Allies) army soldier, in the literal rubble of Poland.

They get married and start a family, but my mom has the property deed. They go to the Polish government and attempt to claim the property. They say they will get back to them. They do!

Polish soldiers literally kick in the door to their home demanding payment of back taxes. Back taxes incurred during non-payment due to World War II.

And that’s that. The lesson to be learned? When it comes to literal real estate during World War II, victims rarely if ever were made whole. Your whole family can be literally murdered, and the surviving government will just shrug. Fin.
