## Playing on the Beach and Finding a Weird Hatch Under the Boardwalk
### About the Time I Was Playing With Some Friends in the Sand Around Brighton 6th Street and I Stumbled Upon A Hatch Buried Under the Sand

By Jack Szwergold

I don’t know if it was a dreary spring day or a dreary fall day, but I do know the day was dreary in some way. It was a “blah” day but not a completely miserable day. Or perhaps it was “overcast” as they say in polite circles? But whatever adjective you would want to use to describe it, the day was neither cold enough to make you want to stay indoors or warm enough to make you avoid wearing some jacket of some kind. And I am positive I was wearing some kind of fall or winter jacket rather than a windbreaker or anything as lightweight as that when I went outside.

All I know it was one of those days I wandered out of my home on Ocean Parkway, headed to the nearby Boardwalk and hooked up with—and played with—whatever neighborhood friends I would bump into.

As I headed east, it was clear that nobody was really doing anything at the 2nd Street playground, and the parking lot next to it that was filled with abandoned buses and stray dogs seemed to be closed. At least the small shack of a concession stand that stood in the middle of the place was closed for the day; so no snacks for me until later.

But the dogs were barking that day and I always found that pleasant, sad and disturbing.

Anyway, I kept on walking and was around Brighton 6th Street when I ran across some neighborhood friends—and friends of friends as well as a few miscellaneous randos—playing ball and running around in the sand. So it seemed to me like it was the place for me to be. So I headed over to the sand and joined them.

“Playing ball” is a vague way of describing what we were doing but we were basically just tossing a pink Spalding rubber ball around and maybe some kind of kickball was mixed into the whole thing from time to time. Whatever we did, it was a simple, stupid, social and fun way to kill off some time during an off day as a kid.

And despite the fact I was getting sand in my sneakers—which annoyed me only when I slowed down enough to notice it—playing around with this motley crew was a fun time. And other than a few random seagulls and old people sitting on benches, we were on our own: The boardwalk and the beach were both calm and quiet and this small bunch of kids was having fun. 

***

At some point a ball came flying my way and flew straight over my head and right into the area under the boardwalk.

“Get it!” someone yelled. And as everyone’s stares confirmed, I missed the catch so I had to go and get it.

The area under the boardwalk was typically dark, quiet and—in all honesty—a bit creepy; no clue where Ben E. King and the Drifters got the inspiration to sing praise to a place like that. But despite the day being overcast and cloudy there was just enough light to make a small area just under the edge of the boardwalk bright welcoming enough to be approachable. So I approached it.

I found the ball pretty quickly, but something else caught my eye. The sand was pretty undisturbed and flattened by the wind during this time of year, but for some reason there was a slight mound a few feet from the beach facing side of the boardwalk. I could barely see what it was, but it seemed intriguing. So I ran out, tossed the ball back to the other kids, and then stepped a bit into the darkness to see what I could see.

Like I said earlier, it wasn’t exactly dark, but it definitely was not as brightly lit as where I found the ball; light mainly came down between the wooden slats that made up the boardwalk above. I looked at the area behind the mound and saw it was was a bit flatter, but definitely not windswept. It seemed as if someone had recently dug out the area and it simply had a light dusting of sand between now and whenever that was.

As I moved closer to the area, I started to notice a few shiny bits of hardware peeking through the sand. I knelt down and brushed away some of the sand with my hand and before you knew it, I saw it: A wooden hatch leading to… Something below.

I immediately got excited and called out to the other kids, “Hey! Come here!” And they did.

“What is it?” Someone said. “It’s some kind of a hatch,” I said as we all gathered around my new discovery to gawk at—and theorize—about it.

“Well, does it open up?” Someone asked. “I don’t know,” I said as a I leaned down, moved my hand across the hatch and tried to find some way of opening the thing. In a few moments I found some kind of handle and—pretty much instantaenously—pulled up and opened the hatch.

The thing was hinged so the hatch would open towards the ocean, and we could all see some kind of rope on the inside of the hatch that was clearly used to pull it closed when someone was inside. But what was inside? Who knew.

We all leaned over and peered down the hatch. Inside we could see some kind of ladder running up the side of the opening. But what was at the bottom? Who knew. There wasn’t enough sunlight shining for us to look down that deeply and before you knew it, this small group of elementary school kids were debating—and daring—each other as to who should go down and explore this new found place.

“You go,” said someone. “No you do it,” said someone else. And this went on for a while until someone said, “Maybe we should get a flashlight?” And then someone else who lived nearby said they would. And with that, whoever they were they were off to get a flashlight.

The rest of us stood around waiting and thinking and then and someone realized they had a book of matches on them. “Let me try this!” they said after pulling out the matches, lighting a few and kneeling down a bit to try to light up the darkness below.

But it didn’t help.

While the lit matches were nice and bright, his arms weren’t long enough and he couldn’t reach down deep enough. Not to mention the idea of hanging a flaming object down that hole made us all worried that somehow he would just drop the matches and set something below us on fire. And that would just get is in trouble and nobody wanted that.

After a while, someone said we should wait to get a flashlight. But the kid who said he would get a flashlight was nowhere to be seen. But seeing what we could see was not a top priority at that moment because we had a new thing to worry about: We heard some people talking urgently in Russian as they walked on the boardwalk above us.

The urge to run was strong but it was too late: Soon enough one of the voices made their way down the Boardwalk stairs, onto the sand below and headed towards straight us.

It was an older Russian man who was kinda bulky but built up; looked like a butcher or a deli man or someone who could carry a sack of produce on their shoulder without breaking a sweat.

He moved towards us slowly, deliberately and repeatedly just said, “Please… Please…” as he git closer, closed the hatch and shooed us away from it and the area under the boardwalk.

As we emerged from the area under the boardwalk the sun was brighter, but it was still cloudy and overcast. We stood in the sand and watched as the guy came out from under the boardwalk, shot us a big smile, pointed to the mound near the hatch and said, “No! Don’t go!” as he climbed up the stairs and back up to the boardwalk itself.

Up on the boardwalk he regrouped with a few other guys who kinda looked like him but were a lot less friendly. They all looked us over but clearly knew we were just kids. Eventually after a short conversation, they all walked away and waved at us and also added an occasional “No!” to the mix; wagging their fingers and pointing down to the area under the boardwalk.

We all waved back to the guys and slowly got back to playing around in the sand. But by that point tossing a ball around wasn’t anywhere as much fun as yammering away and theorizing on what was under that hatch. “What do you think that was there?” one kid asked. And we all had no idea. This kind of verbal ping png went on for a few more minutes until someone said, “I gotta go home!” and soon enough we all dispersed and went back to wherever our respective homes were.

I was up on the boardwalk and headed westward back to Ocean Parkway with no other companions than seagulls squawking into the wind flying above me and the occasional old person sitting on a bench staring off at the sea and the waves in the distance.
