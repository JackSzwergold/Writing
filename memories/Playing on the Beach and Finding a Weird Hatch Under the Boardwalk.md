## Playing on the Beach and Finding a Weird Hatch Under the Boardwalk
### About the Time I Was Playing With Some Friends in the Sand Around Brighton 6th Street and I Stumbled Upon A Hatch Buried Under the Sand

By Jack Szwergold

I don’t know if it was a dreary spring day or a dreary fall dy, but I do know the day was dreary. Or “overcast” as they say in polite circles. Whatever the day was it was neither cold enough to stay indoors or warm enough to avoid wearing some jacket of some kind. And I am positive was wearing more of a fall or winter jacket than a windbreaker or anything else.

All I know it was one of those days I wandered out of my home on Ocean Parkway, headed to the Boardwalk and hooked up with—and played with—whatever neighborhood friends I would bump into.

Nobody was really doing anything at 2nd Street park, and the parking lot next to it that was filled with abandoned buses and stray dogs seemed to be closed. At least the small shack of a concession stand that stood in the middle of the place was closed for the day; so no snacks for me until later.

It was around Brighton 6th Street I ran across some neighborhood friends and friends of friends playing ball and running around in the sand.

Playing ball basically consisted of tossing a Spalding ball around and maybe some kind of kickball. It was simple, stupid and social and I jumped in.

Despite the fact I was getting sand in my sneakers, it was a fun time. The boardwalk was quiet and the beach was quiet. Other than a few random seagulls and old people sitting on benches, we were on our own.

At some point a ball came flying my way and flew over my head and right into the area under the boardwalk.

“Get it!” someone yelled. So I went to get it.

The area under the boardwalk as typically dark, quiet and a bit creepy. But despite the day being overcast there was just enough light to make a small slice of the edge of the under boardwalk area bright enough to be approachable. So I approached it.

I found the ball pretty quickly, but something else caught my eye. The sand was pretty undisturbed during this time of year, but for some reason there was a slight mound a few feet in. I could barely see what it was, but it seemed interesting. So I tossed the ball back to my playmates, and stepped a bit into the darkness to see what was up.

It wasn’t exactly dark, but not as brightly lit; light mainly came from the slats between the wooden boardwalk above. I looked at the area behind the mound and it was a bit flatter. Seemed like it was dug out sometime recently and was covered with a slight dusting of sand.

As I moved closer and started to notice a few shiny bits of hardware peeking through the sand. So I knelt down and moved some of the sand away with my hand and before you know it, I saw it: A wooden hatch leading to… Something below.

I immediately got excited and called out to my freinds, “Hey! Come here!” And they did.

“What is it?” Someone said. “It’s some kind of a hatch,” I said as we all gathered around the hatch to gawk at it.

“Well, does it open up?” Someone asked. “I don’t know, ” I said as a I leaned down and tried to find some way of opening the hatch up. In a few moments I found some kind of handle and pulled up the hatch.

It was hinged so the hatch would open towards the ocean, and we could all see some kind of rope on the inside of the hatch that was clearly used to pull the hatch closed when someone was inside. But what was inside? Who knew.

We all leaned over and peered down the hatch. We could see some kind of ladder running up the side. But what was at the bottom? Who knew. There wasn’t enough sunlight shining for us to seen that deeply and before you knew it, this small group of elementary school kids were debating who should go down.

“You go down,” said someone. “No you do it,” said someone else
