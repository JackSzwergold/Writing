## Playing on the Beach and Finding a Weird Hatch Under the Boardwalk
### About the Time I Was Playing With Some Friends in the Sand Around Brighton 6th Street and I Stumbled Upon A Hatch Buried Under the Sand

By Jack Szwergold

I don’t know if it was a dreary spring day or a dreary fall day, but I do know the day was dreary in some way. It was a “blah” day but not a completely misserable day. Or perhaps it was “overcast” as they say in polite circles? But whatever adjective you would want to use to describe it, the day was neither cold enough to make you want to stay indoors or warm enough to make you avoid wearing some jacket of some kind. And I am positive I was wearing some kind of fall or winter jacket rather than a windbreaker or anything as lightweight as that when I went outside.

All I know it was one of those days I wandered out of my home on Ocean Parkway, headed to the nearby Boardwalk and hooked up with—and played with—whatever neighborhood friends I would bump into.

As I headed east, it was clear that nobody was really doing anything at the 2nd Street playground, and the parking lot next to it that was filled with abandoned buses and stray dogs seemed to be closed. At least the small shack of a concession stand that stood in the middle of the place was closed for the day; so no snacks for me until later.

But the dogs were barking that day and I always found that plesant, sad and disturbing.

Anyway, I kept on walking and was around Brighton 6th Street when I ran across some neighborhood friends—and friends of friends as well as a few miscellaneous randos—playing ball and running around in the sand. So it seemed to me like it was the place for me to be. So I headed over to the sand and joined them.

“Playing ball” is a vague way of describing what we were doing but we were basically just tossing a pink Spalding rubber ball around and maybe some kind of kickball was mixed into the whole thing from time to time. Whatever we did, it was a simple, stupid, social and fun way to kill off some time during an off day as a kid.

And despite the fact I was getting sand in my sneakers—which annoyed me only when I slowed down enought to notice it—playing around with this motley crew was a fun time. And other than a few random seagulls and old people sitting on benches, we were on our own: The boardwalk and the beach were both calm and quiet and this small bunch of kids was having fun.

At some point a ball came flying my way and flew straight over my head and right into the area under the boardwalk.

“Get it!” someone yelled. And as everyone’s stares confirmed, I missed the catch so I had to go and get it.

The area under the boardwalk was typically dark, quiet and—in all honesty—a bit creepy; no clue where Ben E. King and the Drifters got the inspiration to sing praise to a place like that. But despite the day being overcast and cloudy there was just enough light to make a small area just under the edge of the under boardwalk bright enough to be approachable. So I approached it.

I found the ball pretty quickly, but something else caught my eye. The sand was pretty undisturbed during this time of year, but for some reason there was a slight mound a few feet in. I could barely see what it was, but it seemed interesting. So I tossed the ball back to my playmates, and stepped a bit into the darkness to see what was up.

It wasn’t exactly dark, but not as brightly lit; light mainly came from the slats between the wooden boardwalk above. I looked at the area behind the mound and it was a bit flatter. Seemed like it was dug out sometime recently and was covered with a slight dusting of sand.

As I moved closer and started to notice a few shiny bits of hardware peeking through the sand. So I knelt down and moved some of the sand away with my hand and before you know it, I saw it: A wooden hatch leading to… Something below.

I immediately got excited and called out to my friends, “Hey! Come here!” And they did.

“What is it?” Someone said. “It’s some kind of a hatch,” I said as we all gathered around the hatch to gawk at it.

“Well, does it open up?” Someone asked. “I don’t know, ” I said as a I leaned down and tried to find some way of opening the hatch up. In a few moments I found some kind of handle and pulled up the hatch.

It was hinged so the hatch would open towards the ocean, and we could all see some kind of rope on the inside of the hatch that was clearly used to pull the hatch closed when someone was inside. But what was inside? Who knew.

We all leaned over and peered down the hatch. We could see some kind of ladder running up the side. But what was at the bottom? Who knew. There wasn’t enough sunlight shining for us to seen that deeply and before you knew it, this small group of elementary school kids were debating who should go down.

“You go down,” said someone. “No you do it,” said someone else. And this went on for a while. Then someone said, “Maybe we should get a flashlight?” And then someone else who lived nearby said they would. And with that, they were off to get a flashlight.

The rest of us stood around and someone apparently had a book of matches on them. “Let me try this!” they said after they lit a few matches and knelt down to try and light up the hatch opening a bit more but it didn’t help. It just made us all worried that somehow he would drop the matches, set something beneath us in the hatch on fire and then… We would get in trouble. And nobody wanted that.

After a while the kid who said he would get a flashlight was nowhere to be seen. But we could hear some people talking urgently in Russian as they walked on the boardwalk above us. Soon enough one of the voices made their way down the Boardwalk stairs, into the sand below and headed towards us.

It was an older Russian man who was kinda bulky but built up; looked like a butcher or a deli man or someone who could carry a sack of produce on their shoulder without breaking a sweat.

He moved towards us and simply repeatedly said, “Please… Please…” as he closed the hatch and shooed us away from it.

As we emerged from the area under the boardwalk the sun was brighter, but it was still cloudy. We stood back and watched as the guy came out from under the boardwalk, shot us a big smile and say, “No! Don’t go!” as he climbed up the stairs and back up to the boardwalk itself.

Meeting him on the boardwalk were a few other guys who looked like him. One of them a bit cleaner, and a bit slicker. They all looked us over but clearly knew we were kids. Eventually after a short conversation, they all walked away and waved at us and also added an occasional “No!” to the mix; wagging their fingers and pointing down under the boardwalk.

We all waved back and got back to playing. But tossing a ball wasn’t anywhere as much fun as gossiping and theorizing on what was under that hatch. “What do you think that was there?” one kid asked. And we all had no idea. This went on for a few more minutes until someone said, “I gotta go home!” and soon enough we all gotta go home.

And before you knew it I was up on the boardwalk headed back to Ocean Parkway with some seagulls squawking overhead and old people sitting around staring at the sea and doing not much of anything else.
