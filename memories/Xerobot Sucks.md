Did I ever tell you about the time I met Greg Peters (Buttress/Xerobot) at Todd Hanson’s place?

Gather round folks! Let me tell you a tale! @joegarden @todderichanson

P.S. I know you two claim you are not active on Twitter, but I gotta anchor this stuff to something!

I was the late 1990s or so and Todd had just cashed in a royalty check from some Onion related fame. Option deal? Book deal? Whatever. It was a lot of money. And he had just purchased a 36 TV and a PlayStation with “Spider-Man” and wanted to show it off.

So I visited his place to check it out.

It was huge!

But the contrast to that and the utter dump he lived in on N. Hamilton near Pinkus McBride was stark.

But it was still a cool game and a cool setup!

So in the middle hanging out, Gregg Peters stops by. I knew who he was, but never met him. Todd introduced us, “Gregg, this is Jack…”

I stretched out my hand and he coldly responded, “This is the Jew.”

Not a simple “Hello…” 

Just “This is the Jew.”

The what? The guy who identifies with his Judaism because of my parents were Holocaust survivors?

Rob Siegel and Ben Karlin of the Onion were Jews who went to temple, and I didn’t, but I am “The Jew” for what reason?

After that cold introduction, Gregg and Todd looked to me like they were going to do something and should excuse myself.

Were they going to make out? Share recipes? Do drugs? I am pretty sure that it was drugs.

Whatever, I left and went home and that is that.

So that is that for that!

But what I never told Gregg or Todd was the preface to this moment in 1993.

On May 29, 1993 I flew into Madison, WI to take a break from caring for my mom.

She was hospitalized after suffering a series of stokes. She was pretty much non-verbal.

Anyway, that night we headed to O’Cayz Corral to see Gregg Peters’ band Buttress.

Here’s the band’s logo; stylized with the SS lightning bolts.

I was watching the band when a friend ran into O’Cayz Corral to tell me to call home.

My mom had died.

I found out on the pay phone of the Cardinal Bar across the street.

And I found out while watching a band that used the SS lightning bolts because I guess they thought it was “edgy” or some bullshit.

So flash forward to my Onion years, and I had the endure the torment of Todd Hanson when he found out my parents were Holocaust survivors.

At some point, Todd just wanted me gone and he would say I should go study my family history.

That somehow that was what I should be doing instead of creating the Onion’s website. And he would say things like “Jews don’t drink!” to bully and harass me.

All because I decided to reveal my family’s history to what I thought were friends but were just sociopaths.

I’m posting this because in a few days is the sad 30th anniversary of my mom’s death.

Gregg Peters and Todd Hanson are ultimately blips in my life. They are meaningless. They are skin tags.

But I need to share that they scarred me for doing nothing more than who I am.

Are they anti-Semites? I’m not sure. I know that Todd has a “thing” for Jewish women, but mainly as a novelty fetish object. “Jews are so cool!” Todd would literally say at times over they years.
 
And Gregg leans more into the anti-Semite world by calling me “The Jew.”

But I can assure you they are not friends to Jews and they are no friends of mine.

P.S. But hey! If you want a copy of Xerobots tunes, here is their Bandcamp! Yippee!

It it anti-Semitic? I dunno! But it’s member (Gregg Peters) sure is!

PS: Oh hey! I almost forgot to add a legendary Joe Garden bit of anti-Semitism to the mix. Here it goes!

Rob Siegel’s sister was visiting Madison, WI and he was glowering at her the whole time.

Why? I dunno. She wasn’t meddling or doing anything that deserved derision.

Suddenly when she left, he was rocking back and forth in the chair he was sitting in in the hallway and blurted out: “She’s such a… She’s such a Jew!!!”

What the duck? She did nothing but visit her brother? And somehow “She’s such a Jew!!!”

What kinda loonball says that?
