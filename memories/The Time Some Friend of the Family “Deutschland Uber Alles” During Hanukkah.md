## The Time Some Friend of the Family “Deutschland Über Alles” During Hanukkah

By Jack Szwergold

Honestly not too sure when exactly it happened. Pretty sure I was 10 or 11 years old at the time which would have placed this all happening during the holiday season of of 1978 or 1979. Regardless, it happened during Hanukkah with the extended family in Eastchester.

Nobody in my direct family was from Eastchester, but my brother’s in-laws lived in Eastchester. And since my parents really never did anything big for Hanukkah—or any of the holidays actually—the in-law’s Hanukkah celebration ended up being the de-facto “big” and supposedly “proper” celebration in the family despite my mom and dad (and me) not really liking the celebration or the in-laws.

Despite all of the classic jokes and tropes about in-laws, one might not understand why anyone wouldn’t like these particular in-laws. What was not to like? The husband was a baker and the wife was a housewife and after working and toiling in the old—and predominantly German—part of Washington Heights for years they finally “retired” to some condo in Eastchester in their later. Kinda typical Eastern European life path at the time.

But the the larger—and more ethnically specific—deal was that my parents were working class Jewish-Polish immigrants. And these in-laws were middle-class and Jewish-German. The differences might be subtle to some—and that even simplifies it a lot—but there was a lot of implicit, and sometimes explicit, class related bigotry and elitism at play in the way the in-laws interacted with my family.

And one should also know that everyone—my parents and my brother’s in-laws—were Holocaust survivors. And to outsiders that might mean they shared a common bond through a common tragedy but they honestly didn’t. They didn’t like each other; the in-laws in a somewhat slick, passive-aggressive and entitled middle-class way and my parents in a more direct no-nonsense working class way.

A year or so before this incident happened, my mom and dad both—for all intents and purposes—declared they were sick of these in-law hosted celebrations. Phrases like “entitled” or “privileged” really didn’t exist in common language back then. And even if they did my parents weren’t fluent enough in English to use them. But based on the arguments I would hear them engage my brother in on the phone—and sometimes in person—that’s basically what their complaint about the in-laws was about.

As for me, as a mere kid caught in the middle of all of this, I always saw the in-laws as “snotty” and “conceited.” During every visit I had with them I always felt like I was being treated as some kind of pitiful object that needed to be “rescued” or some kind of special case that they were attempting to rescue and rehabilitate.

To be fair, most people treated me as if I was “weird” or “strange” as a kid since my parents were old and clearly immigrants; the WASPy world of American culture punishes those who don’t fit in that WASPy template.

But my brother’s in-law’s always knew how to “kick it up a notch” in their interactions; I always got the general sense they were patronizing me but I sucked it up and tolerated it since during the holidays I would get some decent money or gifts from them.

So back to the incident…

***

By the time Hanukkah came around that year, my parents were hard-set on not going to any more of the in-laws celebrations no matter what.

My brother—as expected—went out of his way to chastise them for thinking and behaving that way, but I understood their point of view. Why go out of your way to have a supposedly “proper” Hanukkah celebration all the way up in Eastchester when the people who invited you were just snotty, judgemental and generally passive-aggresively nasty to the people they invited?

But I was a young kid and bit idealistic—and naive—at the time. I convinced my dad and mom that not going to the in-laws Hanukkah celebration was rude to my brother and generally not nice. Not nice to who? I dunno. But in general, to me—as a kid—it seemed not nice. And being nice was important, right?

So that Hanukkah we all—in our own “grin and bear it” way—begrudgingly headed out to Eastchester to celebrate Hanukkah with the in-laws.

When I showed up everyone else was there already. The in-laws, my brother and his wife, some other miscellaneous family members and Lieszel.

Lieszel was a family friend of the in-laws and was pretty much a central casting example of a dowdy, middle-aged German housewife. Might have been a widower since I never met her husband or even knew if she had children. But in general, she was a stern-faced German-Jewish woman with a poofy blonde hairdo and a judgmental demeanor.

My side of the family was never really friendly to her, but we weren’t unfriendly to her either. She was just this odd creature at these “celebrations” we had to deal with because she was friends with the in-laws.

Now despite the negativity I’m portraying, there were sometimes brief moments of joy at these things. These moments would typically come once the majority of guests arrived and would end shortly before the real “celebration” (typically an overly formal dinner) would happen.

People would be sitting their, talking laughing and joking. Sometimes snacking as well. These moments actually reminded me of the celebrations my family would have at our home, but without the stupid formal dinner that followed. My parents would basically acknowledge the event, pass gifts and well wishes around, and then just hang out. To me that is what a happy celebration would be.

So in the middle of one of these brief, seemingly accidental moments of joy, Lieszel inexplicably stood up from wherever she was was sitting—couch or chair—and started to loudly sing, “Deutschland, Deutschland über alles, über alles in der Welt.”

That was the German national anthem that was hijacked by the Nazis during World War II to shove nationalism down the throats of all. It was quickly dropped after World War II because of the Nazi connections.

But despite these associations, Lieszel decided to start singing the first stanza—the one most famously used and overused by the Nazis—during this family holiday event.

I remember her standing up, singing that bullshit and then sitting down again. But I also remember another thing: Other than my mom and dad instantly getting upset at this bizarre display, nobody else said anything.

My parents were basically flipped out and yelling at my brother about it, but he didn’t think it was a big deal. Neither did his wife or his in-laws. The kids that were around—which consisted of me and my niece from my sister’s side barely understood what just happened and were basically just stunned and silent.

After Lieszel sat down, my brother’s mother-in-law came over and started to whisper in German in Lieszel’s ear as they both looked around at us.

I might have been a kid at the time, but neither of them seemed to broken up about the incident despite the fact it was—frankly—crazy. Not to mention that at no point did Lieszel even attempt to apologize. The look on her face reminded me of the stern and judgmental—and frankly shitty—elementary school teachers I dealt with growing up. But at least when it came to teachers, I could go home at the end of the day. Now somehow we all had to sit down and break bread with this unapologetic loon.

Needless to say, the fun and laughter stopped and we all just sat around and awkwardly waited for dinner to start.

In the case of Hanukkah, dinner only started after the Hanukkah Menorahs were lit. So when the Menorahs were pulled out, we all gathered, lit the Menorahs and then sat down to dinner.

***

To say it was awkward was an understatement at best. The dinner that happened after all of that was filled with pregnant pauses and awkward interactions. I don’t recall what we ate, but it was most likely some shitty brisket, beans, sweet potatoes and other crap like that.

I honestly liked the brisket, but the Nazi anthem thing kinda ruined it.

After the dinner, the kids would wait for gifts to arrive and sometimes we would play Dreidel. If we were lucky, my brother’s father-in-law would turn on the TV so I could sit and just stare at flashing pictures on a screen until it was time to go home.

And again, at no point did Lieszel apologize for anything despite the fact that even my mom and dad were arguing with my brother in Polish at sporadic times during the night about how she behaved. My general impression is my brother thought it was no big deal and our parents were overreacting. I had watched my brother fight with our parents tons of times. But this time it was different. Instead of defending his own parents against the bullying of others, he was clearly apologizing and defending the bully.

Lieszel deciding to sing a Nazi anthem was one thing; the reaction of others was another. That Hanukkah, the Hanukkah I insisted my parents should put differences aside to celebrate the holiday as a family was the one where this crap happened. And my brother had nothing to say past claiming my parents were overreacting to it all.

Saying my brother’s behavior was a betrayal of his own family seems too simple. Calling it gaslighting would also be too cut and dry. But from that moment on I finally understood honestly and fully why my parents hated their in-laws: They were bigots in their own genteel way and their own son was buying their bigotry hook, line and sinker for little to no good reason.
