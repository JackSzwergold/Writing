## The Time Some Friend of the Family “Deutschland Uber Alles” During Hanukkah

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: The time some old crone spontaneously stood up and just started to sing “Deutschland Uber Alles” during a family Hanukkah dinner. Mind you 75% of the family consisted of Holocaust survivors.

***

I’m not too sure when exactly it happened. Pretty sure I was 10 or 11 years old at the time which would have placed it happening square in 1978 or 1979. Regardless, it happened during Hanukkah withthe family in Eastchester.

Nobody in my direct family was from Eastchester, but my brother’s in-laws lived in Eastchester. And since my parents really never did anything big for Hanukkah—or any of the holidays actually—the in-law’s Hanukkah celebration ended up being the defacto “big” celebration in the family despite others not really liking the celebration or the in-laws.

***

Superficially, one might not understand why anyone wouldn’t like those in-laws. The husband was a baker and the wife was a housewife and after working and toiling in Washington Heights for years they finally “retired” to some condo in Eastchester. Kinda typical.

But the deal was that my parents were working class and Polish. The in-laws were middle-class and German. That simplifies it a lot, but there was a lot of implicit—and sometimes explicit—classism and elitism at play in the way the in-laws interacted with my family.

I should also state that all of them—my parents and my brother’s in-laws—were Holocaust survivors. And to outsiders that should mean they shared a common bond through tragedy but they didn’t. They hated each other; the in-laws in a passive-aggresive entitled middle-class way and my parents in a more direct no-nonsense working class way.

***

Anyway, a year or so before the incident, my mom and dad both—for all intents and purposes—declared they were sick of these in-law celebrations. Phrases like “enitled” or “privledged” really didn’t exist in common language back then. And even if they did my parents weren’t fluent enough in English to use them. But based on the arguments I would hear them engage my brother in on the phone, that’s basically their complaint about the in-laws.

As for me, I always saw them as “snotty” and “conceited.” Every visit I had with them I felt like I was being treated as a rescue animal or special case. To be fair, most people treated me as if I was weird as a kid since my parents were old and immigrants. But my brother’s in-law’s always “kicked it up a notch” in their interactions; I always got the general sense they were patronizing me but tolerated it since during the holidays I would get some decent money or gifts from them.

So back to the incident: By the time Hanukkah came around that year, my parents were hard-set on not going to any more of the in-laws celebrations.

My brother—as expected—chastized them for thinking and behaving that way, but I saw their point. Why have a supposedly “proper” Hanukkah celebration when the people throwing it were just snooty, bourgeois and  passively nasty to the people they invited?

But I was a young kid and bit idealistic at the time. I convinced my dad and mom that not going to the in-laws Hanukkah celbration was not nice. Not nice to who? I dunno. But in general, to me—as a kid—it seemed not nice. And being nice was important, right?

So that Hanukkah we all headed out to Eastchester to celebrate the holiday with the in-laws.

When I showed up everyone else was there already. The in-laws, my brother and his wife, some other miscellaenous family members and Lieszel.

Lieszel was a family friend of the in-laws and was pretty much a central casting example of a dowdy, middle-aged German housewife. Might have been a widower since I never met her husband or even knew if she had children. But in general, she was a stern-faced German-Jewish woman with a poofy blonde hairdo and a judgementaln demeanor.

My side of the family was never really friendly to her, but we weren’t unfriendly to her either. She was just this odd creature at these “celebrations” we had to deal with because she was friends with the in-laws.

Now despite the negativity I’m portraying, there were sometimes brief moments of joy at these things. These moments woud typically come once the majority of guests arrievd and would end shortly before the real “celebration” (typically an overly formal dinner) would happen.

People would be sitting their, talking laughing and joking. Sometimes snacking as well. These moments actually reminded me of the celebrations my family would have at our home, but without the stupid formal dinner that followed. My parents would basically acknowledge the event, pass gifts and well wishes around, and then just hang out. To me that is what a happy celbrarion would be.

So in the middle of one of these brief, seemingly accidental moments of joy, Lieszel inexplicably stood up from wherever she was was sitting—couch or chair—and started to loudly sing, “Deutschland, Deutschland über alles, über alles in der Welt.”

That was the German national anthem that was hijacked by the Nazis during World War II to shove nationalism down the throats of all. It was quickly dropped after World War II because of the Nazi connections.

But despite these associations, Lieszel decided to start singing the first stanza—the one most famously used and overused by the Nazis—during this family holiday event.

I remember her standing up, singing that bullshit and then sitting down again. But I also remember another thing: Other than my mom and dad instantly getting upset at this bizarre display, nobody else said anything.

My parents were basically flipped out and yelling at my brother about it, but he didn’t think it was a big deal. Neither did his wife or his in-laws. The kids that were around—which consisted of me and my niece from my sister’s side barely understood what just happened and were basically just stunned and silent.

After Lieszel sat down, my brother’s mother-in-law came over and started to whisper in German in Lieszel’s ear as they both looked around at us.

I might have been a kid at the time, but neither of them seemed to broken up about the incident despite the fact it was—frankly—crazy. Not to mention that at no point did Lieszel even attempt to apoligize. The look on her face reminded me of the stern and judgemental—and frankly shitty—elementary school teachers I dealt with growing up. But at least when it came to teachers, I could go home at the end of the day. Now somehow we all had to sit down and break bread with this unapologetic loonball.

Needless to say, the fun and laughter stopped and we all just sat around and awkwardly waited for dinner to start.

In the case of Hanukkah, dinner only started after the Hanukkah Menorahs were lit. So when the Menorahs were pulled out, we all gathered, lit the Menorahs and then sat down to dinner.

***

To say it was awkward was an understatement at best. The dinner that happened after all of that was fileld with pregnant pauses and awkward interactions. I don’t recall what we ate, but it was most likely some shity brisket, beans, sweet potatoes and other crap like that.

I honestly liked the brisket, but the Nazi anthem thing kinda ruined it.

After the dinner, the kids would wait for gifts to arrive and sometimes we would play Dreidel. If we were lucky, my brother’s father-in-law would turn on the TV so I could sit and just stare at flashing pictures on a screen until it was time to go home.

And again, at no point did Lieszel apologize for anything despite the fact that even my mom and dad were arguing with my brother in Polish at sporadic times during the night about how she behaved. My general impression is my brother thought it was no big deal and our parents were overreacting. I had watched my brother fight with our parents tons of times. But this time it was different. Instead of defending his own parents against the bullying of others, he was clearly apologizing and defending the bully.

Lieszel deciding to sing a Nazi anthem was one thing; the reaction of others was another. That Hanukkah, the Hanukkah I insisted my parents should put differences aside to celebrate the holiday as a family was the one where this crap happened. And my brother had nothing to say past claiming my parents were overreacting to it all.

Saying my brother’s behavior was a betrayl of his own family seems too simple. Calling it gaslighting would also be too cut and dry. But from that moment on I finally understood honestly and fully why my parents hated their in-laws: They were bigots in their own genteel way and their own son was buying their bigotry hook, line and sinker for little to no good reason.
