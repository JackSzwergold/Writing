## The Time Some Friend of the Family “Deutschland Uber Alles” During Hanukkah

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: The time some old crone spontaneously stood up and just started to sing “Deutschland Uber Alles” during a family Hanukkah dinner. Mind you 75% of the family consisted of Holocaust survivors.

I’m not too sure when exactly it happened. Pretty sure I was 10 or 11 years old at the time which would have placed it happening square in 1978 or 1979. Regardless, it happened during Hanukkah withthe family in Eastchester.

Nobody in my direct family was from Eastchester, but my brother’s in-laws lived in Eastchester. And since my parents really never did anything big for Hanukkah—or any of the holidays actually—the in-law’s Hanukkah celebration ended up being the defacto “big” celebration in the family despite others not really liking the celebration or the in-laws.

Superficially, one might not understand why anyone wouldn’t like those in-laws. The husband was a baker and the wife was a housewife and after working and toiling in Washington Heights for years they finally “retired” to some condo in Eastchester. Kinda typical.

But the deal was that my parents were working class and Polish. The in-laws were middle-class and German. That simplifies it a lot, but there was a lot of implicit—and sometimes explicit—classism and elitism at play in the way the in-laws interacted with my family.

I should also state that all of them—my parents and my brother’s in-laws—were Holocaust survivors. And to outsiders that should mean they shared a common bond through tragedy but they didn’t. They hated each other; the in-laws in a passive-aggresive entitled middle-class way and my parents in a more direct no-nonsense working class way.
