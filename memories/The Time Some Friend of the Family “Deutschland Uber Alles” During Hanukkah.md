## The Time Some Friend of the Family “Deutschland Uber Alles” During Hanukkah

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: The time some old crone spontaneously stood up and just started to sing “Deutschland Uber Alles” during a family Hanukkah dinner. Mind you 75% of the family consisted of Holocaust survivors.

***

I’m not too sure when exactly it happened. Pretty sure I was 10 or 11 years old at the time which would have placed it happening square in 1978 or 1979. Regardless, it happened during Hanukkah withthe family in Eastchester.

Nobody in my direct family was from Eastchester, but my brother’s in-laws lived in Eastchester. And since my parents really never did anything big for Hanukkah—or any of the holidays actually—the in-law’s Hanukkah celebration ended up being the defacto “big” celebration in the family despite others not really liking the celebration or the in-laws.

***

Superficially, one might not understand why anyone wouldn’t like those in-laws. The husband was a baker and the wife was a housewife and after working and toiling in Washington Heights for years they finally “retired” to some condo in Eastchester. Kinda typical.

But the deal was that my parents were working class and Polish. The in-laws were middle-class and German. That simplifies it a lot, but there was a lot of implicit—and sometimes explicit—classism and elitism at play in the way the in-laws interacted with my family.

I should also state that all of them—my parents and my brother’s in-laws—were Holocaust survivors. And to outsiders that should mean they shared a common bond through tragedy but they didn’t. They hated each other; the in-laws in a passive-aggresive entitled middle-class way and my parents in a more direct no-nonsense working class way.

Anyway, a year or so before the incident, my mom and dad both—for all intents and purposes—declared they were sick of these in-law celebrations. Phrases like “enitled” or “privledged” really didn’t exist in common language back then. And even if they did my parents weren’t fluent enough in English to use them. But based on the arguments I would hear them engage my brother in on the phone, that’s basically their complaint about the in-laws.

As for me, I always saw them as “snotty” and “conceited.” Every visit I had with them I felt like I was being treated as a rescue animal or special case. To be fair, most people treated me as if I was weird as a kid since my parents were old and immigrants. But my brother’s in-law’s always “kicked it up a notch” in their interactions; I always got the general sense they were patronizing me but tolerated it since during the holidays I would get some decent money or gifts from them.

So back to the incident: By the time Hanukkah came around that year, my parents were hard-set on not going to any more of the in-laws celebrations.

My brother—as expected—chastized them for thinking and behaving that way, but I saw their point. Why have a supposedly “proper” Hanukkah celebration when the people throwing it were just snooty, bourgeois and  passively nasty to the people they invited?

But I was a young kid and bit idealistic at the time. I convinced my dad and mom that not going to the in-laws Hanukkah celbration was not nice. Not nice to who? I dunno. But in general, to me—as a kid—it seemed not nice. And being nice was important, right?

So that Hanukkah we all headed out to Eastchester to celebrate the holiday with the in-laws.

When I showed up everyone else was there already. The in-laws, my brother and his wife, some other miscellaenous family members and Lieszel.

Lieszel was a family friend of the in-laws and was pretty much a central casting example of a dowdy, middle-aged German housewife. Might have been a widower since I never met her husband or even knew if she had children. But in general, she was a stern-faced German-Jewish woman with a poofy blonde hairdo and a judgementaln demeanor.

My side of the family was never really friendly to her, but we weren’t unfriendly to her either. She was just this odd creature at these “celebrations” we had to deal with because she was friends with the in-laws.

Now despite the negativity I’m portraying, there were sometimes brief moments of joy at these things. These moments woud typically come once the majority of guests arrievd and would end shortly before the real “celebration” (typically an overly formal dinner) would happen.

People would be sitting their, talking laughing and joking. Sometimes snacking as well. These moments actually reminded me of the celebrations my family would have at our home, but without the stupid formal dinner that followed. My parents would basically acknowledge the event, pass gifts and well wishes around, and then just hang out. To me that is what a happy celbrarion would be.

So in the middle of one of these brief, seemingly accidental moments of joy,
