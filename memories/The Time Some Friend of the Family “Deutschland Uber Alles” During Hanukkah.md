## The Time Some Friend of the Family “Deutschland Uber Alles” During Hanukkah

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: The time some old crone spontaneously stood up and just started to sing “Deutschland Uber Alles” during a family Hanukkah dinner. Mind you 75% of the family consisted of Holocaust survivors.

I’m not too sure when exactly it happened. Pretty sure I was 10 or 11 years old at the time which would have placed it happening square in 1978 or 1979. Regardless, it happened during Hanukkah withthe family in Eastchester.

Nobody in my direct family was from Eastchester, but my brothers in-laws lived in Eastchester.
