## Throwing Rocks at the Building
### About How—When Summer Came Around—Kids Waiting for the Coney Island Bound Subway Train Would Throw Rocks at the Building I Lived In

By Jack Szwergold

The window of my bedroom in the apartment I grew up in faced the elevated subway station. It wasn’t like the trains were literally right outside my window, but there was nothing between me and the station other than a low-rise retail building that was about as long and deep in length and depth as my building.

This was a mixed blessing because while, on the one hand, we could see people getting off the train, if I could see people standing on the subway platform, they could see us too.

My dad liked to wait and watch for my mom get off the train when she came back home from work each day from my room. So the view was useful in some ways.

On the other hand, privacy in a situation like that wasn’t much beyond a polite concept at best. Unless I wanted to keep the shades down all day and night, people waiting for the Coney Island bound D train could easily peer into my room from the train platform if they wished to.

Which is all to say, I got used to the window situation 75% of the year. It’s just that 25% of the year when summer came around that the really annoying bullshit began to happen.

You see, the subways at the time—pre-1990s—had rocks and gravel poured into the trackbed to soak up dripping oil, grease and under train crap like that. And during the summer, adventurous lunkheads who visited beautiful Brighton Beach via Ocean Parkway would literally jump onto the tracks, grab a handful of rocks and then use our building for target practice. Either to impress themselves or impress some gum cracking gal they just spent the afternoon with.

Rock throwing didn’t happen all of the time, but it happened often enough that we all knew what was happening if we heard a dull clunking sound on the walls outside the building’s apartment windows.

But they weren’t just tossing the rocks to hit brick bare brick. Some folks clearly wanted to hit a target and break some windows.

This really pissed off Johnny, the building superintendent. Some days he would just stand in the airway of the building where the rocks would fall and exasperatedly pick them up as they came down. On other days—when he felt more decisive—he would grab his baseball bat, run to the station, jump the turnstile and chase people away. He did this often enough that the MTA token agent knew who he was and knew what he was doing and wouldn’t page out of transit police to chase him down.

Hilariously Johnny’s faithful guard dog Fluffy— the dog would bark without hesitation at anyone who passed by the basement entrance—was utterly silent when rocks landed near her. She’d spend most of the day in that airway just napping and yapping, but if a rock fell? She might open her eyes, look at it and then go back to her dog napping world.

That said, we were all lucky because many of these shirtless beach bums were weak armed and had bad aim. But occasionally they would hit their target.

One day I heard the sound of breaking glass, but had no idea where it came from so I didn’t think too much about it. I only discovered the source of the shattering noise months later when a strong snowstorm came by and I could hear the faith sound of wind in my room. It turned out the top of the storm window in my room was busted in a perfect circle.

I told my dad about it, found a window place nearby in Sheepshead Bay and had it fixed. It cost $39 and I paid for all of it with money from my meager part-time job savings.

But it still didn’t change the fact that come summer, the beaches would be clogged with people and we all had to worry about lunkheads using our home as target practice.
