## Throwing Rocks at the Building
### About How—When Summer Came Around—Kids Waiting for the Coney Island Bound Subway Train Would Throw Rocks at the Building I Lived In

By Jack Szwergold

The window of my bedroom in the apartment I grew up in faced the elevated subway station. It wasn’t like the trains were literally right outside my window, but there was nothing between me and the station other than a low-rise retail building that was about as long and deep in length and depth as my building.

If I could see people standing on the subway platform, they could see me too.

This was a mixed blessing because—on the one hand—we could see people getting off the train. My dad liked to wait and watch for my mom get off the train when she came back home from work each day.

On the other hand, privacy wasn’t much beyond a polite concept.

Despite it all, you got used to it during 75% of the year. But it’s when the summer came around that the real bullshit happened.

You see, the subways at the time had rocks and gravel poured into the trackbed at the time. And during the summer, adventurous lunkheads would literally jump onto the tracks, grab a handful of rocks and then use our building for target practice.

It didn’t happen all of the time, but it happened often enough that we all knew what was happening if we heard a dull clunking sound on the walls outside our apartment windows.

But they weren’t just tossing the rocks to hit brick. Some folks clearly wanted to break windows.

This really pissed off Johnny, the building superintendent. Some days he would just stand in the airway of the building where the rocks would fall and exasperatedly pick them up. On other days, he would grab his baseball bat, run to the station, jump the turnstile and chase people away.

Hilariously his guard dog, Fluffy, that would bark at any kid who passed by the basement entrance was utterly silent when rocks landed near her. She’d spend most of the day in that airway just napping and yapping, but if a rock fell? She opened her eyes, looked at it and got on with her boring dog life.

Lucky for us many of these shirtless beach bums were weak armed and had bad aim. But occasionally they would hit their target.

One day I heard the smash of breaking glass, but had no idea where it came from. I only discovered it months later when a strong snowstorm came by and I could hear wind in my room. Turned out a window pane on the top of the storm window frame was busted in a perfect circle.

I told my dad about it, found a window place in the neighborhood and had it fixed.

But it still didn’t change the fact that come summer, the beaches would be clogged with people and we all had to worry about lunkheads using our home as target practice.
