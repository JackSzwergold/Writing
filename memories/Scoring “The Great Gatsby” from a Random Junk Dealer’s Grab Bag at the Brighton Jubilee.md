## Scoring “The Great Gatsby” from a Random Junk Dealer’s Grab Bag at the Brighton Jubilee
### About the Time I Went I Scored a Copy of “The Great Gatsby” From a Junk Dealer’s Selection of Grab Bags

The Brighton Jubilee was a street fair started by a local Brighton Beach neighborhood association back in the mid-1970s to help promote the neighborhood. And the neighborhood needed a good promotional effort—if not a friendly slap on the back and some basic reassurance—at the time since as much as I loved it, it was indeed a depressing craphole in many ways.

And unlike modern street fairs that seem like cookie cutter affairs filled with the same or similar vendors selling the same or similar stuff, the Brighton Jubilee—at least in it’s early years—was truly more of a local neighborhood affair. Lots of local vendors and shops setup card tables and sold whatever they thought they could sell. And if you kept your eyes peeled, you might find a true cool bargain.

It was sometime in August in the early 1980s when I was wandering around the Brighton Jubilee looking for some cool stuff to score. While I was already in junior high school, I still had a big soft spot for novelties, pranks and magic. You know, joy buzzers, invisble ink and trick ice cubes with flies in them and stuff like that. And there was always at least one vendor selling some of that kinda of stuff at this street fair.

As I wandered around, I passed tons of vendors selling silly string and those snap/pop things you threw on the sidewalk to make explode but not much else. Then I stumbled across what could only be described as a small array of tables selling a truly random—and questionable—pile of junk somewhere around Brighton 13th Street.

The older guy who ran the table—and his wife—seemed to be very nice. The table—and area beneath it, near it and around it—was filled with stuff either culled from the garbage or the left over detritus (aka: “estate”) from someone’s apartment after they passed away. An oddball array of tin cans and an whole mess of hardware and related tools littered the ground. Occasionally something nice like a small porcelain statuette would pop up, but that was about it.

I poked around the table, and eventually found a small, humble array of misfit toys gathered around one corner of the table. But none of what I saw really interested me. When I was about to give up and move on to another vendor’s table, I spotted a bunch of stuffed paper bags—that were stapled shut—that had lots of hand drawn question marks and “$1” written on the side of them. The sign near them clearly explained: “Grab Bags $1 Each.”

So I asked the guy what was inside of those “Grab Bags” and he simply said, “All kinds of stuff! Buy one and see!”

“Yeah, buy one and see!” said a friend of mine who joined me in my street fair wandering. So I gave him a dollar, and slowly moved my hand over the table to see which of the bags would be mine… And soon enough I picked one, stepped back and began to open it.

I ripped open the stapled top of the bag and rolled it’s crumbled top open to look inside and see what I could see.

Inside was a humble mix junk: Some marbles, a few toy soldiers, some junky trading cards and even a few pieces of hardware—like a fuse or electrical adapter—and even a semi-usable ballpoint pen. It was like a minature sampling of the items this guy sold at the table… But in a bag! But there mixed in with bthe other stuff—but physically bigger than the other junk—was a slightly water damaged copy of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby.”

“Wow!” my friend said, “That’s a good book!” he added. The guy who ran the junk table agreed, “You scored a good one!” he said as he looked at me admiring my score while simultaneously eyeing other people rummaging through his junk.

“I never read this,” I added. In fact at that point in my young life I truly hated reading. It was always a chore and seemingly—based on the way that teachers treated it in lessons—some kind of punishment that teachers bestowed upon kids. So I avoided reading whenever I could.

But this time I was actually excited to have—and read—a book. I mean “The Great Gatsby” is a respectable piece of literature, right? And this time around I wasn’t being bullied, pressured or cajoled into reading it by some miserable teacher. Rather, I wanted to read it because I somehow—via luck, magic or pure randomness—scored it out of a seemingly worthless bag of junk being sold by some guy just selling piles of junk.

And it was honestly the first book I ever truly enjoyed reading in a few days from cover to cover.

I could write about how Gatsby’s longing for Daisy resonated with me, but that would be a lie. There was little about the book I could relate to other than Gatsby was one level of rich kid living on Long Island longing for the love and attention of another level or rich kid living on Long Island: Daisy. But the core theme of the book is not what drew me in; the flow of the words is really what got to me. The ease of the prose and the seemingly honest expression of ideas—even if they weren’t things I could relate to—is what drew me in.

And I learned all this on my own. Not thanks to any teacher or assignment but rather the pure luck of picking the right grab bag of junk at the right time from the right street vendor during a neighborhood street fair.
