## Scoring “The Great Gatsby” from a Random Junk Dealer’s Grab Bag at the Brighton Jubilee
### About the Time I Went I Scored a Copy of “The Great Gatsby” From a Junk Dealer’s Selection of Grab Bags

By Jack Szwergold

The Brighton Jubilee was a street fair started by a neighborhood association back in the mid 1970s to help promote the neighborhood. Unlike modern street fairs that seem like cookie cutter afairs filled with the same or similar vendors selling the same or similar stuff, the Brighton Jubilee at the time was truly more of a local affair. Lots of local vendors and shops setup card tables and sold whatever they though they could sell. And if you kept your eyes peeled, you might find a true bargain.

It was sometime in the early 1980s when I was wandering around the Brighton Jubilee looking for some cool stuff to score. While I was already in junior high school, I still had a big soft spot for novelties, pranks and magic. And there was always at least one vendor selling some of that stuff at this street fair.

As I wandered, I passed tons of vendors selling silly string and those snap/pop things you tossed at the pavement but not much else. Then I stumbled across what could only be described as a small array of tables selling a truly random pile of junk around Brighton 13th Street.

The guy who ran the table—and his wife—seemed to be very nice. The table—and area beneath it—was filled with stuff either culled from the garbage or the left over remains of someone’s apartmnent after they passed away. Odd tin cans and an array of tools littered the ground. Occassionally something nice like a small porcelain statuette would pop up, but that was it.

I did eventually found a small array of misfit toys on the table, but nothing that reall interested me. As I was about to take off, I spotted a pile of filled paper bags that were stapled shut near one side of the table. The sign near them said, “Grab Bags $1 Each.”

So I asked the guy what was inside of them and he basiclaly said, “All kinds of stuff! Buy one and see!”

“Yeah, buy one and see!” said a friend of mine who joined me in my wandering. So I gave him a dollar, and slowly moved my hand over the table to see
