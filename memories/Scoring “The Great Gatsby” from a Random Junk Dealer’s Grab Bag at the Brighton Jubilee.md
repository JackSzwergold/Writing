## Scoring “The Great Gatsby” from a Random Junk Dealer’s Grab Bag at the Brighton Jubilee
### About the Time I Went I Scored a Copy of “The Great Gatsby” From a Junk Dealer’s Selection of Grab Bags

By Jack Szwergold

The Brighton Jubilee was a street fair started by a neighborhood association back in the mid 1970s to help promote the neighborhood. Unlike modern street fairs that seem like cookie cutter affairs filled with the same or similar vendors selling the same or similar stuff, the Brighton Jubilee at the time was truly more of a local affair. Lots of local vendors and shops setup card tables and sold whatever they though they could sell. And if you kept your eyes peeled, you might find a true bargain.

It was sometime in August in the early 1980s when I was wandering around the Brighton Jubilee looking for some cool stuff to score. While I was already in junior high school, I still had a big soft spot for novelties, pranks and magic. And there was always at least one vendor selling some of that stuff at this street fair.

As I wandered, I passed tons of vendors selling silly string and those snap/pop things you tossed at the pavement but not much else. Then I stumbled across what could only be described as a small array of tables selling a truly random pile of junk around Brighton 13th Street.

The guy who ran the table—and his wife—seemed to be very nice. The table—and area beneath it—was filled with stuff either culled from the garbage or the left over remains of someone’s apartment after they passed away. Odd tin cans and an array of tools littered the ground. Occasionally something nice like a small porcelain statuette would pop up, but that was it.

I did eventually found a small array of misfit toys on the table, but nothing that really interested me. As I was about to take off, I spotted a pile of filled paper bags that were stapled shut near one side of the table. The sign near them said, “Grab Bags $1 Each.”

So I asked the guy what was inside of them and he basically said, “All kinds of stuff! Buy one and see!”

“Yeah, buy one and see!” said a friend of mine who joined me in my wandering. So I gave him a dollar, and slowly moved my hand over the table to see which of the bags would be mine… And soon enough I picked one out and stepped back.

As I ripped open the stapled top of the bag and rolled it’s top open I looked in to see what I could see.

Inside was a veritable pile of tiny bits of junk: Some marbles, a few toy soldiers, some junky trading card and even a few pieces of hardware like a fuse and maybe even a ballpoint pen. But there looming in plain sight—but bigger than the other crap—was a copy of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby.”

“Wow!” my friend said, “That’s a good book!” he added. The guy who ran the junk table agreed, “You scored a good one!” he said as he looked on at me admiring my score while eyeing other people rummaging through his junk.

“I never read this,” I added. In fact at that point in my young life I hated reading. It was always a chore and seemingly—based on the way that teachers treated it in lessons—some kind of punishment that teachers bestowed upon kids. So I avoided reading whenever I could.

But this time I was excited to read this book. I mean “The Great Gatsby” is a respectable book? And this time around I wasn’t being bullied, pressured or cajoled into reading it by some teacher. But rather I wanted to read it because I magically scored it out of a seemingly random bag of junk being sold by some guy just selling piles of junk. And it was honestly the first book I ever truly enjoyed reading in a few days from cover to cover.

I could write about how Gatsby’s longing for Daisy resonated with me, but that would be a lie. There was little about the book I could relate to other than Gatsby was one level of rich kid living on Long Island longing for the love and attention of another level or rich kid living on Long Island: Daisy. But the core theme of the book is not what drew me in; the flow of the words is really what got to me. The ease of the prose and the seemingly honest expression of ideas—even if they weren’t things I could relate to—is what drew me in.

And I learned all this on my own. Not thanks to any teacher or assignment but rather the pure luck of picking the right grab bag of junk at the right time from the right street vendor during a neighborhood street fair.
