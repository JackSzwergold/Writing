## The Last Passover I Had With My Family
### About the Last Passover I Ever Observed With My Siblings

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICKNOTES**: About the last Passover I had at my sister’s home in Bensonhurst. It was 2005 or 2006. My nephew didn’t show up, my sister complained, my brother shouted at her and shoved her against a wall. I saw my niece curled up in a fetal position on a couch. My nephew shows up and like robots, everyone did “Passover.”

While I came from a Jewish famliy, my parents were secular. To his death my dad would say that religion was “bullshit” and as a kid I would usually ascribe this to his experience during the Holocaust. But as an adult, I’ve grown to realize there’s no history of faith or belief in my family past the usual, “This is our community and this is what we do…” mentality.

In contrast, as my siblings grew older they all started to take their belief in Judaism to deeper and deeper extremes. While our family never really obsereved Passover, my siblings saw it as some duty to force a “real” Passover experience down the throats of the whole family.

Which is all to say: While I saw Passover as simply a unique holiday where Jews got together to meet and greet each other, my siblings took it more seriously than anyone else I knew.
