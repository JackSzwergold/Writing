## The Last Passover I Had With My Family
### About the Last Passover I Ever Observed With My Siblings

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICKNOTES**: About the last Passover I had at my sister’s home in Bensonhurst. It was 2005 or 2006. My nephew didn’t show up, my sister complained, my brother shouted at her and shoved her against a wall. I saw my niece curled up in a fetal position on a couch. My nephew shows up and like robots, everyone did “Passover.”

While I came from a Jewish famliy, my parents were secular. To his death my dad would say that religion was “bullshit” and as a kid I would usually ascribe this to his experience during the Holocaust. But as an adult, I’ve grown to realize there’s no history of faith or belief in my family past the usual, “This is our community and this is what we do…” mentality.

In contrast, as my siblings grew older they all started to take their belief in Judaism to deeper and deeper extremes. While our family never really obsereved Passover, my siblings saw it as some duty to force a “real” Passover experience down the throats of the whole family.

Which is all to say: While I saw Passover as simply a unique holiday where Jews got together to meet and greet each other, my siblings took it more seriously than anyone else I knew.

I attended these evenst not because I too believed in Elijah the Prophet showing up or some nonsense like that, but rather because both of my sibilings families have dealt with divorce and abuse over the years so I saw my attendance as something that could add a layer of normalcy to the family’s lives. Especially my nephews and nieces who—despite their obvious lack of deep faith themselves—seemed to need some stability in the midst of familial chaose they were born into.

Anway, the year was 2005 of 2006. I was prepared to participate in my sister’s Passover seder. I showed up as I always did and met the family that was there as well as the small group of friends my sister had at her Temple.

As usual, we waited for my brother and his kids to show up. This was fairly typical: My brother and his kids would show up whenever they wanted and barely apologized for any screwups their lateness caused. “Don’t sweat the small stuff,” my brother would always say, “And it’s all the small stuff.” 

When my brother showed up he showed up with my niece—who seemed not into the idea of attending this event at all—but nowhere in sight was his son, my nephew.

This seemed odd at the moment. My nephew had just moved to Brooklyn a year or so prior and was going to college here. He lived in Prospect Heights. While he had to get to my sister’s place on his own, there’s little to no reason he had to be late.

“Where is he?” I calmly asked my brother, to which he shouted, “I don’t know!” which was a warning sign already.

We waited some more. Sundown had already passed. Everyone was antsy, but nobody wanted to start the Seder without my nephew and even less people dared to ask yet again, “Where is he?”

My brother got on the phone with my nephew and it turned out he forgot today was the Seder at all. He was still at home in Prospect Heights after spending some of the day at his grandmother’s home.

We found this all out after my brother hung up the phone and told us all about it adding a “This is no big deal!” to the end of the explanation. Easilly 8-9 people were sitting there waiting for the Seder to start but it was supposedly “No big deal!” that his son had forgotten it was happening and was leaving us in a lurch.

Suddenly something odd happened. My sister spoke up and said something to the effect of “If this was his grandmother’s Seder and any of us were late, we would be getting grief!”

My sister never spoke up. When she was a in a crappy abusive relationship with her ex—and now dead—husband she said nothing. When her own brother turned a blind eye to the abuse she endured at her ex-husband she said nothing. She was practically a human doormat when it came to power and men in her life who treated her like crap and never spoke up… But today was amazing! She finally spoke up!

I was thrilled for a second or two… And that quickly passed into being terrified as my brother—like a bulldog—rushed at her, grabbed her by the shoulders and shoved her against the wall. “Don’t talk about my son this way!” he screamed as he pushed her against the wall.

I ran out to see what was happening and he immediately barked at me, “Stay out of this!!!” as his hands grasped my sister’s shoulders and she stood there, lifeless like a rag doll.
