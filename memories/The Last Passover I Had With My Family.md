## The Last Passover I Had With My Family
### About the Last Passover I Ever Observed With My Siblings

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: About the last Passover I had at my sister’s home in Bensonhurst. It was 2005 or 2006. My nephew didn’t show up, my sister complained, my brother shouted at her and shoved her against a wall. I saw my niece curled up in a fetal position on a couch. My nephew shows up and like robots, everyone did “Passover.”

While my parents were Jewish, the home my parents raised me in was secular. My parents weren’t in denial of our Jewish background, but rather simply aware of the basics and not much else. To his literal death my father would say that religion was “bullshit” and would often ascribe what he defined as “bullshit” to the way God treated the Jewish people during the Holocaust. If there is a God, why would he/she/it ever allow such a tragedy to happen? As a child I often wondered if my parents were somehow faithful before World War II and then suddenly dropped their religion after the war. But as an adult whose learned some more about my own family’s history over the years, I’ve grown to realize there’s no history of religious faith or deep belief in my family past the usual, “This is our community and this is what we do…” mentality. My family is historically secular.

In contrast, as my siblings grew older they all started to take their belief in Judaism to deeper and deeper extremes. For example, while our family never really observed Passover, my siblings saw it as some deep obligation to force a “real” Passover experience down the collective throats of our whole immediate family.

Which is all to say: While I saw Passover as simply a unique holiday where Jews got together to simply get together—such as a Jewish version of Thanksgiving and such—my brother and sister took it far more seriously than anyone else I knew.

So I attended these events—way past my childhood obligation—not because I somehow believed the magical spirit of Elijah the Prophet would show up to drink a goblet of wine set on the table for him or some bullshit lke that. I attended because both of my siblings families have dealt with a lot of sad and violent dysfunction over the years—divorce as well as physical and psychological abuse—so I saw my attendance as something that I could do to add a layer of normalcy to the immediate family’s lives. A layer of normalcy that I especially hoped would help my nephews and nieces who—despite their obvious lack of deep religous faith themselves—seemed to need some stability in the midst of familial chaos and bullshit they were born into.

Anyway, the year was 2005 or 2006. I was prepared as much as I could to participate in my sister’s Passover seder. I showed up as I always did and met the family that was there as well as the small group of friends my sister had at her local Temple.

As usual, we waited for my brother and his kids to show up. This was fairly typical: My brother and his kids would show up whenever they wanted to despite set times and when they showed up they barely apologized for any difficulties or frustrations their lateness caused. “Don’t sweat the small stuff! And it’s all the small stuff.” my brother would always shout. And we all nodded poiltely and tolerated it because there was not much we could do to change it.

So when my brother finally showed up, he showed up with my niece, who seemed not into the idea of attending this event at all. But there was no sign of his son; my nephew.

This seemed odd at the moment. My nephew lived in Brooklyn—in Prospect Heights—while he went to school in Manhattan. So while it was his job to get to my sister’s home on his own, there was little to no reason he had to be late like this at all.

“Where is he?” I calmly asked my brother, to which he shouted, “I don’t know!!!” which was a warning of things to come; my brother was getting revved up at the idea of anyone questioning anyone in his direct family for any reason.

We all waited some more. So much so that sundown had already passed and—technically—we were late for the start of Passover.

Everyone was clearly antsy, but nobody wanted to start the Seder without my nephew. And given his response to my simple question, even less people dared to ask yet again, “Where is he?”

But then my brother got on the phone with my nephew and it turned out he forgot today was the Seder at all. He was still at home in Prospect Heights after spending some of the day at his grandmother’s home completely oblivious to the family he had just blown off.

We all found out about this after my brother hung up the phone and told us all adding a “This is no big deal!!!” to the end of the explanation to premptively shut us all up. There were 8 to 9 people sitting there, doing nothing, waiting for the Seder to start but it was supposedly “No big deal!!!” that his son had forgotten about it.

Then, in the middle of the awkward silence something odd happened. My sister, who never really spoke up about anything, suddenly spoke up and said something to the effect of “If this was his grandmother’s Seder and any of us were late, we would be getting grief!”

Like I said, my sister never really spoke up so this was all shocking and amazing. When she was a in a shitty abusive relationship with her ex—and now dead—husband she said utterly nothing. When her own brother turned a blind eye to the abuse she endured at the hands of her ex-husband she said nothing. She was practically a human doormat when it came to people in power in her life who treated her like crap and truly never spoke up… But today was amazing! She finally spoke up! This was truly a Passover miracle!

I was thrilled for a second or two… But that thrill quickly turned into terror as my brother—like a mad animal—instantly rushed at her, grabbed her by the shoulders and shoved her against the wall. “Don’t talk about my son this way!” he screamed as he pushed her against the wall. “Don’t lie!” he added.

I ran out into the hallway to see what was happening and he immediately shouted at me, “Stay out of this!!!” His hands were clenched on my sister’s shoulders as she stood there silent and lifeless; like a rag doll.

Despite his threats, I walked towards him and said, “Leave her alone! She said the right thing! Why do we have to wait for your family all the time?” He turned to me and started barking again. I walked past him, walked into the kitchen and stood near the phone.

As I looked at him holding her against the wall, I looked over at the phone and did not know what to do. My arms were crossed, my fists were clenched and my brain felt like it was about to explode. If I called the police, what would happen? My brother and sister are masochists; it would end up being my word against theirs because my sister would not fight back and would pretty much claim nothing happened. Her friends in attendance would not speak up at all for similar reasons; when power speaks reality takes a back seat.

Then I turned and looked at all the the stuff near the sink and saw a huge kitchen knife; maybe if I stabbed him he would stop? But then again, what would have happened? I would have stabbed my own brother, my sister would most likely blacked out the whole incident and claim she has no idea what would have happened as well. If I stabbed him I might have gone to jail for assault despite the fact I did so to defend my own family because “That’s just the way it is…”

After a few minutes things started to calm down. His hands were still on her, but at least was calm enought that I could walk past them and back to the living room. There I saw my niece curled up in a fetal position on the couch. I asked her if she was okay and she lifted her head: While she nodded her head to indicate she was okay, it was prety clear from the glistening of tears and redness in her cheeks she was anything but okay.



I looked into the living room and saw the menagerie of “friends” my sister had. They sat their motionless like a bunch of dullards. Not one of them stood up and said or did anything throughout this incident. Not when it started nor now when it ended. They sat their patiently and obediently—not even asking me how I was doing or coming to comfort my niece—as violence occurred a room away from them.

I looked at them, turned my head, found a seat and sat down to wait… To wait for my nephew to finally show up so we could all—as a “family”—celebrate the magic of Passover.

Some short time later—after dust had settled—the bell rang and there was my nephew. He was there apologizing and making nice to everyone. The events that just transpired were washed away and the “magic” of this kid showing up changed everyone’s tune.

He really went out of his way to apologize for his actions; so much so I even told him, “Just sit down and let’s have a meal…”

So as the Seder began, we all read from the Haggadah. We all took turns to read one paragraph like we always did, but when it came to my nephew he read a second paragraph… And then a third… As each obvious paragraph break happened I attempted to speak up and say he should allow others to read, but my brother and sister shushed me. My sister’s dullard friend said nothing; but that isn’t fair to them… The reality is nobody said anything. And I just accepted the reality of the situation and went along with it.

Soon enough we were actually eating a meal. But as I ate I looked around and saw abusers, the abused and people who sat back and said nothing. While other Seders had given me headaches in the past, the feeling of death and “Why am I wasting my life?” washed over me.

When I left my sister insisted I take home some food from the Seder despite my protests that I didn’t want anything. When I got home, I took off my jacket, lifted up the toilet cover and just flushed the food she gave me down the toilet.
