## The Last Passover I Had With My Family
### About the Last Passover I Ever Observed With My Siblings

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: About the last Passover I had at my sister’s home in Bensonhurst. It was 2005 or 2006. My nephew didn’t show up, my sister complained, my brother shouted at her and shoved her against a wall. I saw my niece curled up in a fetal position on a couch. My nephew shows up and like robots, everyone did “Passover.”

While my parents were Jewish, the home my parents raised me in was secular. My parents weren’t in denial of our Jewish background, but rather simply aware of the basics and not much else. To his literal death my father would say that religion was “bullshit” and would often ascribe what he defined as “bullshit” to the way God treated the Jewish people during the Holocaust. If there is a God, why would he/she/it ever allow such a tragedy to happen? As a child I often wondered if my parents were somehow faithful before World War II and then suddenly dropped their religion after the war. But as an adult whose learned some more about my own family’s history over the years, I’ve grown to realize there’s no history of religious faith or deep belief in my family past the usual, “This is our community and this is what we do…” mentality. My family is historically secular.

In contrast, as my siblings grew older they all started to take their belief in Judaism to deeper and deeper extremes. For example, while our family never really observed Passover, my siblings saw it as some deep obligation to force a “real” Passover experience down the collective throats of our whole immediate family.

Which is all to say: While I saw Passover as simply a unique holiday where Jews got together to meet and greet each other, my siblings took it more seriously than anyone else I knew.

I attended these events not because I too believed in Elijah the Prophet showing up or some nonsense like that, but rather because both of my siblings families have dealt with divorce and abuse over the years so I saw my attendance as something that could add a layer of normalcy to the family’s lives. Especially my nephews and nieces who—despite their obvious lack of deep faith themselves—seemed to need some stability in the midst of familial chaos they were born into.

Anyway, the year was 2005 of 2006. I was prepared to participate in my sister’s Passover seder. I showed up as I always did and met the family that was there as well as the small group of friends my sister had at her Temple.

As usual, we waited for my brother and his kids to show up. This was fairly typical: My brother and his kids would show up whenever they wanted and barely apologized for any screwups their lateness caused. “Don’t sweat the small stuff,” my brother would always say, “And it’s all the small stuff.” 

When my brother showed up he showed up with my niece—who seemed not into the idea of attending this event at all—but nowhere in sight was his son, my nephew.

This seemed odd at the moment. My nephew had just moved to Brooklyn a year or so prior and was going to college here. He lived in Prospect Heights. While he had to get to my sister’s place on his own, there’s little to no reason he had to be late.

“Where is he?” I calmly asked my brother, to which he shouted, “I don’t know!” which was a warning sign already.

We waited some more. Sundown had already passed. Everyone was antsy, but nobody wanted to start the Seder without my nephew and even less people dared to ask yet again, “Where is he?”

My brother got on the phone with my nephew and it turned out he forgot today was the Seder at all. He was still at home in Prospect Heights after spending some of the day at his grandmother’s home.

We found this all out after my brother hung up the phone and told us all about it adding a “This is no big deal!” to the end of the explanation. Easily 8-9 people were sitting there waiting for the Seder to start but it was supposedly “No big deal!” that his son had forgotten it was happening and was leaving us in a lurch.

Suddenly something odd happened. My sister spoke up and said something to the effect of “If this was his grandmother’s Seder and any of us were late, we would be getting grief!”

My sister never spoke up. When she was a in a crappy abusive relationship with her ex—and now dead—husband she said nothing. When her own brother turned a blind eye to the abuse she endured at her ex-husband she said nothing. She was practically a human doormat when it came to power and men in her life who treated her like crap and never spoke up… But today was amazing! She finally spoke up!

I was thrilled for a second or two… And that quickly passed into being terrified as my brother—like a bulldog—rushed at her, grabbed her by the shoulders and shoved her against the wall. “Don’t talk about my son this way!” he screamed as he pushed her against the wall.

I ran out to see what was happening and he immediately barked at me, “Stay out of this!!!” as his hands grasped my sister’s shoulders and she stood there, lifeless like a rag doll.

I still walked towards him and said, “Leave her alone! She said the right thing! Why do we have to wait for your family all the time?” He turned to me and started barking again. I walked past him and stood near the phone.

I looked at him holding her, looked at the phone and did not know what to do. My arms were crossed and my brain was about to explode. If I called the police, what would happen? My brother and sister are masochists; it would end up being my word against theirs because my sister would not fight back.

I looked at the stuff near the sink and saw a huge kitchen knife; maybe I could stab him and he would stop? But then again, what would happened. I would have stabbed my own brother, my sister would most likely black out of the whole incident and claim she has no idea what would have happened. If I did that I might have gone to jail for defending my own family from abuse because “That’s just the way it is…”

As things calmed down, I walked past them and back to the living room. There I saw my niece curled up in a fetal position on the couch. I asked her if she was okay. She lifted her head and you could see the glistening of tears and redness in her cheeks as she nodded that she was okay when she clearly wasn’t.

I looked into the living room and saw the menagerie of “friends” my sister had. They sat their motionless like a bunch of dullards. Not one of them stood up and said or did anything throughout this incident. Not when it started nor now when it ended. They sat their patiently and obediently—not even asking me how I was doing or coming to comfort my niece—as violence occurred a room away from them.

I looked at them, turned my head, found a seat and sat down to wait… To wait for my nephew to finally show up so we could all—as a “family”—celebrate the magic of Passover.

Some short time later—after dust had settled—the bell rang and there was my nephew. He was there apologizing and making nice to everyone. The events that just transpired were washed away and the “magic” of this kid showing up changed everyone’s tune.

He really went out of his way to apologize for his actions; so much so I even told him, “Just sit down and let’s have a meal…”

So as the Seder began, we all read from the Haggadah. We all took turns to read one paragraph like we always did, but when it came to my nephew he read a second paragraph… And then a third… As each obvious paragraph break happened I attempted to speak up and say he should allow others to read, but my brother and sister shushed me. My sister’s dullard friend said nothing; but that isn’t fair to them… The reality is nobody said anything. And I just accepted the reality of the situation and went along with it.

Soon enough we were actually eating a meal. But as I ate I looked around and saw abusers, the abused and people who sat back and said nothing. While other Seders had given me headaches in the past, the feeling of death and “Why am I wasting my life?” washed over me.

When I left my sister insisted I take home some food from the Seder despite my protests that I didn’t want anything. When I got home, I took off my jacket, lifted up the toilet cover and just flushed the food she gave me down the toilet.
