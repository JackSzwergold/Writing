## Going to My First Comic Convention and Getting Ripped Off
### About the Time I Went to My First Comic Convention and Finding Out I Got Ripped Off on the “Battlestar Galactica” #1 I Bought From a Classmate

By Jack Szwergold

It was the 1970s, I was in elementary school, had a meager $2 a week allowance and liked to buy comics. I wasn’t some hardcore collector of any kind, but I just liked to buy comics that caught my eye at the time.

My favorite superhero comic was *Spider-Man* with *Iron Man* close behind. I didn’t really follow any deep storylines or get into the deep sci-fi logic of the worlds; I just liked the way the comics looked and the overall basic story that I read.

Since comics were cheap back then, I would score some new ones at the local newsstands. But more often than not I would dig through the used bins at the local bookstore, “Nostrand Books.” They would buy comics for at least 5 cents a pop and then sell some of the used comics for 10 cents to 25 cents a pop. This was a decent economic transaction for some of the kids in the neighborhood.

But regardless of whatever comic I bought for my own enjoyment at the time, in the back of my mind the idea of “striking gold” and finding a comic that was worth something was ever present. More often than not, scoring a “Number 1” comic was a theoretical ticket to smalltime wealth and fame. I mean, people paid good money for first issues of famous comics, right? So buying a number 1 issue of almost anything was a good investment, right?

Anyway, back in the spring of 1979 the original *Battlestar Galactica* was a semi big deal on TV and the tie-in/cash-in comic book was a semi big deal as well. The first issue of that comic came out, but nobody I knew could score a copy. “It’s gotta be worth something!” friends would say, but none of us knew how much it was worth since we were just 10 or 11 years old at the time.

So one day in the cafeteria—as we were all sitting around and talking about this, that and the other—someone chimed in and said, “Hey! You know, Phillip has a copy of *Battlestar Galactica* #1.” And everyone’s eyes lit up.

Philip was a cool kid, but didn’t really mingle with our table. He was Pilipino and hung out at another table. But one day—before one of our classes started—I poked Philip in the back with a pencil and asked, “You have a copy of *Battlestar Galactica* #1?” “Yeah,” he said. “You want it?” he added.

At that moment I just wanted to know if he had a copy, but the idea of getting it was something else. “Well, bring it in and let me see it,” I said.

“Sure,” he said. “I’ll bring it in tomorrow,” he added as the teacher started to talk and we all started to listen.

The next day we all waited at the lunch table for Philip to show up, but he was nowhere to be found. “Did he cut out of class?” someone asked to which we all shrugged and had nothing much else to add.

Then—seemingly out of nowhere—Phillip came over to the table, sat down and opened up his book bag.

“Okay,” he said as he opened the flap of the olive drab Musette book bag and pulled the copy of *Battlestar Galactica* #1 out from between some books.

It was in a protective mylar bag and rested on an acid free backing board and we were all impressed. You only really spent the extra money for a bag and backing board for comics that are worth something.

When he pulled the comic out we were a bit less impressed. The cover had some dings and folds and it was clearly already read; this comic was not in mint condition but rather it was “fair” to “good” at best.

He passed it over to me and as I flipped through it he said, “You can have it for $5.” A few kids gasped and looked at each other. “$5?” I said, “This isn’t mint and it sold for 35 cents when you got it,” I added. He then came back at me and said, “Okay, how about $3.50.” To which I retorted, “I’ll give you $3.25 since that’s all I have.”

There was a pause, and he said yes and with that I pulled out $3.25 in a mix of crumbled dollar bills and change from my pocket and paid him for it.

As he took the money and I took the comic, I quickly place it back into the bag.

“You know that’s gonna be worth something someday!” one of my friends said. I nodded and thought I made a good investment. I might have been only 10 years old at the time, but dreams of selling this comic for $15 or maybe $20 when I was 20 years old swam through my head.

For the first time in my life I made a financial plan for the future and I was damned proud of myself.

When I got home I showed my dad what I bought and he was feigning pride thinking I only paid the 35 cents cover price for it. Then I told him how much I actually paid for it and he exclaimed, “What?!?!” as I blubbered and said it would be worth something someday. “Okay,” he said. “But you have to take care of it,” he added. I nodded yes as I took it back to my room and carefully stored it way at the bottom beneath all of the other comics in my night stand.

A few weeks passed, and school had ended. While not exactly summer, it was a nice spring day when I got a call from a friend asking if I wanted to go to a comic convention in the city.
