## Going to My First Comic Convention and Getting Ripped Off
### About the Time I Went to My First Comic Convetion and Finding Out I Got Ripped Off on the “Battlestar Galactica” #1 I Bought From a Classmate

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: I paid $3.25 for a copy of “Battlestar Galactica” #1 from Phillip. Someone at the convention was wandering around and had a pile of them selling for 25 Cents

It was the 1970s, I was in elementary school, had a meager $2 a week allowance and liked to buy comics. I wasn’t some hardcore collector of any kind, but I just liked to buy comics that caught my eye at the time.

My favorite superhero comic was *Spider-Man* with *Iron Man* close behind. I didn’t really follow any deep storylines or get into the deep sci-fi logic of the worlds; I just liked the way the comics looked and the overall basic story that I read.

Since comics were cheap back then, I would score some new ones at the local newsstands. But more often than not I would dig through the used bins at the local bookstore, “Nostrand Books.” They would buy comics for at least 5 cents a pop and then sell some of the used comics for 10 cents to 25 cents a pop. This was a decenct economic transaction for some of the kids in the neighborhood.

But regardless of whatever comic I bought for my own enjoyment at the time, in the back of my mind the idea of “strking gold” and finding a comic that was worth something was ever present. More often than not, scoring a “Number 1” comic was a theorhetical ticket to smalltime wealth and fame. I mean, people paid good money for first issues of famous comics, right? So buying a number 1 issue of almost anything was a good investment, right?

Anway, back in the spring of 1979 the original *Battlestar Galactica* was a semi big deal on TV and the tie-in/cash-in comic book was a semi big deal as well. The first issue of that comic came out, but nobody I knew could score a copy. “It’s gotta be worth something!” friends would say, but none of us knew how much it was worth since we were just 10 or 11 years old at the time.

So one day in the cafeteria—as we were all sitting around and talking about this, that and the other—someone chimed in and said, “Hey! You know, Phillip has a copy of *Battlestar Galactica* #1.” And everyone’s eyes lit up.

Philip was a cool kid, but didn’t really mingle with our table. He was Philipino and hung out at another table. But one day—before one of our classes started—I poked Philip in the back with a pencil and asked, “You have a copy of *Battlestar Galactica* #1?” “Yeah,” he said. “You want it?” he added.

At that moment I just wanted to know if he had a copy, but the idea of getting it was something else. “Well, bring it in and let me see it,” I said.

“Sure,” he said. “I’ll bring it in tomorrow,” he added.
