It was 1976, she was my second grade teacher at P.S. 100 and she was abusive. But please, let me set the scene.

P.S. 100 was located in the smack dab of the working class, secular Jewish, predominantly white, ghetto known as Trump Village. It was a relatively small, 4-story pink bricked monument to elementary school education and a remnant of a neighborhood lost long ago when Fred Trump, Donald Trump’s dad, decided to redevelop the area as a middle class monument to mid-century design and working class living.

P.S. 100 was located between West 2nd Street and West 3rd Street, it’s location was a remnant of the old neighborhood grid that was effectively wiped away with the creation of the new mega-block grid Trump Village required.

The seven buildings of Trump Village stood as monuments to middle class American aspirations in the 1960s. Each building topped out at 23 stories, their bland designs were only slightly ameliorated by designer/architect Morris Lapidus’ slight attempts mid-century Florida chic. While he is best known for designing such stunners like The Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach, none of that garish sophistication graced his utilitarian Trump Village buildings. They we truly housing blocks in the tradition of the mega blocks that Robert Moses dreamed of: Bland, cookie cutter human storage towers filled with working class families.

Nobody ever played in the neighboring playgrounds of Trump Village buildings. Yeah, they were “stylish” with modern-ish takes on such staples as monkey bars, turtles you climbed on and the occasional horse you would ride. But nobody really played on them. And rarely did the elders of the community sit on the wooden benches that surrounded them either; this was a stark contrast to my 4 story tennement walkup life where elders (aka: Yentas) sat in front of their buildings daily.

Such was the reality of any housing complex that consisted of 23 stories accessible mainly by elevator; people chose to keep to themselves and getting the occasional fresh air from the dozens of private terraces that spotted the outsides of each building.

Anyway, enough about the milieu and onto the meat of this piece!

It was 1976, I was barely 8 years old and one day when I was playing with one of the other oddball kids in the class — who happened to be a black kid — my teacher freaked out.

When I say “oddball,” I mean the school was predominantly filled with white, middle-class, secular Jewish kids from Trump Village and not “freaks” like me: A white, secular Jewish kid who came from a poor immigrant family living in a tenement in Brighton Beach. Or a black kid who was poor and lived in Coney Island like the kid I was playing with. Heck, I don’t even know if she was freaking out because I was a white kid playing with a black kid or because we wouldn’t just sit down and be quiet, but she freaked out.

It was the end of the day, we were all waiting to be sent home and just running around desks. Horsing around. Smiling and laughing. And then suddenly she screamed, grabbed us both by the ear and tossed us like bags of sand into the giant wooden wall closet.

The closet was one of those shallow closets with sliding doors that everyone hung their stuff in. The closet was mostly empty since it was the end of the day and everyone had their stuff at their desks already.

The right side of my head landed hard on the wood that held the coat hooks and just inches away from a metal jacket hook that was right in front of my face. My hands managed to brace the rest of my body against the plaster wall; slowing me down a bit not much. The black kid I was playing with landed a few feet down from me in the closet. He was facing me when he landed and seemed to hit his head the same way I did.

We both started screaming and crying as she quickly slid the door closed to muffle our cries. It was dark with some light from the outside coming it, but mostly dark. The other students outside were quiet with only the occasional noise of shuffling or coughing. She kept us locked in the closet until school ended 5 minutes later. Then she let us out as if nothing happened.

I told my parents about what happened when I got home and they complained to the school. And the “reward” for complaining was not having the teacher reprimanded or fired but was the administration of the school saying I was mis-zoned for P.S. 100. Meaning they were kicking me out. I was officially sent to P.S. 253 for 3rd grade.

P.S. 253 was supposedly the “bad” school in the core of Brighton Beach where all the non-Trump Village kids went. But at least it was in my immediate, immigrant-filled, mixed, working-class, tenement-filled neighborhood. And everyone there was an “oddball” in some way so at least I had a better chance of fitting in.
