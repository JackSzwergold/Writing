## Iron Maiden, Guns and Video Games
### About the Time I Had a Gun Pulled Out in Front of Me While Listening to Iron Maiden and Playing Video Games

By Jack Szwergold

I was hanging out at a neighborhood friend’s house in the early 1980s. We both had Atari computers—I had an Atari 400 and he had an Atari 800—and we spent time copying games and trying to figure out how to play games we copied.

You see, if you pirated a video game back then—in the pre-Internet age—you didn’t necessarily get an instruction manual telling you how the game worked or even what the basic contols were. Were there keys on the keyboard you had to use? What happened if you did this thing during this screen and that thing during another screen? All that kind of basic stuff you would know if you actually purchased the game outright.

So part of the process of video game pirating—at least for me and my small circle of software pirating friends—was to do some primitive, improvised version of digital “forensics” with friends to figure out how these games worked. And when I say “digital” I don’t mean just 1s and 0s and bits and bytes. Often the hacking method we used was to just smash our hands across the keyboard to see what happened. It was a simple and effective method of figuring out how software worked without having to do things like decompile a binary and wade through raw, undocumented code.

Anyway, I was over at my friend’s place playing and copying some video games which was a tedious process back then since storage media and devices were slow, tedious and unreliable at best. Even moreso for a poor kid like me who couln’t afford a disk drive at the time and only had a measely, slow data cassette tape drive to use.

So while we were waiting for games to copy, we’d often do other things teenagers did: Like listen to pop music and talk about nonsense and other bullshit. Like my friend’s new guitar.

“So what do you think about the guitar?” he asked while holding it, and strumming it, in his lap. The guitar in question was a classic black and white Fender Stratocaster. He just got it and a basic amp a week or so ago. He wasn’t pro musician or expert or anything like that—in all honesty I don’t recall him ever really studying music in the formal sense—but he was definitely into the guitar.

“Seems cool,” I said as I looked it over. “What can you play?” I asked.

He then compose himself a bit, plugged the guitar into the amp and proceeded to play that classic of novice guitarists worldwide:  The opening riff to *Deep Purple*’s “Smoke on the Water.” It sounded cool, but it was pretty basic.

“Here,” he said, “Let me show you.” he added as he gave me the guitar and showed me which strings to hit and hold. Gotta admit… It was basic, but fun. Then I got bored and looked around the room and there I saw it: A flocked, blacklight poster of the cover of Iron Maiden’s “Number of the Beast.”

“Whoa! When did you get that!” I asked.

“About a week ago,” my friend said. “Pretty cool, right?”

Indeed it was. While I was looking at it without the glow of blacklight, the poster was amazing: The blacks were so deep and black. The yellows and other fluorescent colors still glowed even in the non-blacklight of the afternoon sun. But more importantly, the message of the poster was amazing: There was Eddie—Iron Maiden’s mascot—writ large, the puppet master of the devil who was in-turn the puppet master of some dude in the middle of some pile of flames in hell. The more you think of it, it makes no sense: Who is the devil the puppet master of? But if you think about it just hard enough, that poster can blow your mind.

“I’m gonna get a blacklight next week,” my friend says.

“Let me know!” I said as I stared at the poster again.

Just then, I heard the sound of someone coming out of a bathroom. It was my friend’s dad. I had no idea he was even there yet taking a shower, but anyway… There he was in the doorway of my friend’s room wearing just a bath towel and some slippers.

“Jack,” he said, “Come here… I want to show you something…” he said.

“Pa!” my friend said, “Come on?” he said.

“Don’t worry! Done’t worry!” he said, “Jack come here let me show you something…” he said as he walked into the master bedroom next door. I followed.

As I walked in, I saw him rummage through a nightstand next to the bed. The room itself was basic Russian gaudy: While the apartment itself wasn’t big, the master bedroom was tricked out, ornate and over-decorated. Lots of mirrors and details that made you feel like you lived in a playhouse, but for real.

“Here!” he said, “I have it now!” he said as he stood up, turned around and showed me what he had in his hand. It was a small sliver plated handgun. Had never seen an actual gun before in my life, but the gun looked legit.

“Jack, why do I need to have this?,” he said shaking it in his hand, “Look at this Jack. I never use it. Why do I need this, Jack?”

I stood fairly dumbfounded and speechless. I simply went along with it and said, “I don’t know…”

All the while his son—my friend—stood behind me and repeatedly said some variation of “Pa! Dad! Please… Stop… Stop it… Please…”

I looked at his dad and he seemed a bit drunk but coherent. “Jack, you want this?” he said, “Let me show you…”

I shook my head no, headed back to my friend’s room while my friend looked at me, looked at his dad and started talking to him in Russian. He put his hand on his dad’s shoulder and made him put the gun away.

I sat down on the edge of the bed in my friend’s room, picked up the guitar and dawdled with it a bit as I peered into the master bedroom: I could see my friends dad push the drawer of the nightstand closed and climb into bed. My friend still talked to him in Russian as his father laid down.

Eventually, my friend left the master bedroom, closed the door and came back into his room. He looked at me, but didn’t said anything. I shifted himself so he could squeeze into the room and dicked around a bit on the guitar while staring at the poster of Eddie on the wall.

It was dusk and the sun was setting. I put the guitar down, stood up and asked, “So let me know when get that blacklight, okay?” “Sure,” he said as I gathered my stuff and headed out the front door.
