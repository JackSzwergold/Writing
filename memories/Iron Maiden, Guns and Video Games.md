### About the Time I Had a Gun Pulled Out in Front of Me While Listening to Iron Maiden and Playing Video Games

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: Russian friend whose dad worked a crappy job at a gourmet deli in Manhattan yet had tons of money. One day in the 1980s—when I was in junior high school—while playing video games and futzing around on guitars, he told me to come into his bedroom. I go in and he’s standing there in nothing but a robe with a small silver handgun in his hand. He’s asking me, “Jack, why do I need to have this? Look at this Jack. I never use it. Why do I need this, Jack?” Never calls it a gun but is jostling it and shuffling it between each hand. His son (my friend) keeps on pleading to his dad by saying, “Dad… Dad…” repeatedly. I keep on saying “I dunno…” and eventually go back to my friend’s room. We sat down and looked at each other and didn’t really talk about what just happened. He closed the door and I just sat there, trying to play around with some video games some more but I mainly sat and stared at his huge Iron Maiden poster of Eddie from “Number of the Beast“ on his wall.

I was hanging out a friend’s house in the early 1980s. We both had Atari computers—I had an Atari 400 and he had an Atari 800—and we spent time copying games and trying to figure out games.

You see, if you pirated a video game back then—in the pre-Internet age—you didn’t necessarilly get an instruction manual telling you how the game worked or even what keys on your keyboard you could use to do things.

So part of the process of pirating—at least for me—was to do some primitive “forensics” with friends to share notes and ideas on how certain games worked. This often just meant just smashing your hand across the keyboard and paying attention.

Anyway, I was over at my friend’s home copying, playing and goofing around with some video games. Copying was a tedious process so while tapes and diskettes copied, we’d often do other things: Like listen to music and talk about shit.

“What do you think about the guitar?” my friend asked. The guitar in question was a black and white Fender stratocaster he just got. He was no pro or expert, but he was definitely into the guitar.

“Seems cool,” I said, “What can you play?” I asked.

He then stood up a bit and proceeded to play the opening riff to Deep Purple’s “Smoke on the Water.” Sounded cool, but it was pretty basic.

“Here,” he said, “Let me show you.” he added as he gave me the guitar and showed me which strings to hit and hold. Gotta admit… It was basic, but fun. Then I got bored and looked around the room and there I saw it: A flocked, blacklight poster of the cover of Iron Maiden’s “Number of the Beast.”

“Whoa! When did you get that!” I asked.

“About a week ago,” my friend said. “Pretty cool, right?”

Indeed it was. While I was looking at it without the glow of blacklight, the poster was amazing: The blacks were so deep and black. The yellows and other flourescent colors still glowed even in the non-blacklight of the afternoon sun. But more importantly, the message of the poster was amazing: There was Eddie—Iron Maiden’s mascot—writ large, the puppet master of the devil who was inturn the puppet master of some dude in the middle of some pile of flames in hell. The more you think of it, it makes no sense: Who is the devil the puppet master of? But if you think about it just hard enough, that poster can blow your mind.

“I’m gonna get a blacklight next week,” my friend says.

“Let me know!” I said as I stared at the poster again.
