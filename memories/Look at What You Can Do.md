## Look at What You Can Do!

By Jack Szwergold

I was working late on a Friday at the publication’s office on State Street. It was only Rob and me in the office. Rob next door in his tiny office and me in the larger production office.

Todd, Maria And John were done doing their writing and miscellaneous bullshit and heard out to Nick’s down the street. 

After an hour or so, Todd, Maria And John come back from Nick’s bar on State Street. Everyone was creaky drunk but not completely incoherent.

The three of them head over to where Rob and I are and drunkly say hello. I wave, put my headphones back on and get back to work. They shift over to Rob’s office and joke about him not going out to drink, “I mean Jews don’t drink, right?” Todd says in a jokey menacing way shifting his eyes to me and Rob while he said it.

I smirked, took a deep breath and went back to work.

Suddenly Todd grabs Maria, forces a kiss on her and shoves his hand down her pants in front of Rob’s office while I am next door in the design office. He shouted, “Look Rob! Look at what you can do to Maria when she’s drunk!”
