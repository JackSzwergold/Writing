## Look at What You Can Do!

By Jack Szwergold

It was sometime in the late 1990s. Maybe 1997 or 1998. I was still living in the midwest and still working for the wacky weekly local newpaper; which was a thing back in the late 1990s.

I think it was fall or winter, but I remember it was dark and I was working late on a Friday at the publication’s office on ass end of State Street; right near the capitol and across the street from the porn shop. It was only Rob and I in the office with Rob next door in his tiny—yet powerful—“I’m the editor!” office and me in the larger production office that would usually be crammed with 3 people during most days.

Three of the old school writers—Todd, Maria and John—were done wrapping up their writing and miscellaneous bullshit and such and were getting ready to head out to Nick’s bar down the street to get a few beers and some food.

“You sure you don’t want to go?” one of them asked me and then asked Rob. I politely declined and they headed out.

After an hour or so the three of them came back from Nick’s and everyone was clearly drunk but not completely incoherent. More like they were pleasantly buzzed. But I barely remeber them being actually being that pleasant when buzzed, lit or simply fucked up on anything.

The three of them stumbled into the office, headed over to where the offices Rob and I were in and drunkly said “Hello!” to us.

I stopped what I was doing, politely smiled and waved at them, put my headphones back on and then quickly got back to work. They then shifted their drunken welcome wagon over to Rob’s office, greeted him as they did me but then started to give him drunkn grief about him not going out to drink with them.

Within seconds of them saying Rob should drink more, Todd blurted out, “I mean Jews don’t drink, right?” He did it in the same jokey—yet menacing—way all of the stupid passive-aggresive nonsense came out of him. I looked at him, let the wind of that bullshit pass over me and then was ready to go back to work when his eyes shifted to me and he blurted out the same thing again, “I mean Jews don’t drink, right Jack?”


I smirked, took a deep breath and went back to work.

Suddenly Todd grabs Maria, forces a kiss on her and shoves his hand down her pants in front of Rob’s office while I am next door in the design office. He shouted, “Look Rob! Look at what you can do to Maria when she’s drunk!”
