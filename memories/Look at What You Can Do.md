## Look at What You Can Do!
### About the Time I Watched a Co-Worker Treat a Fellow Co-Worker Like Garbage

By Jack Szwergold

It was sometime in the late 1990s. Maybe 1997 or 1998. I was still living in the midwest and still working for the wacky weekly local newspaper; which was a thing back in the late 1990s.

I think it was fall or winter, but I remember it was dark and I was working late on a Friday at the publication’s office on ass end of State Street; right near the capitol and across the street from the porn shop. It was only Rob and I in the office with Rob next door in his tiny—yet powerful—“I’m the editor!” office and me in the larger production office that would usually be crammed with 3 people during most days.

Three of the old school writers—Todd, Nadia and John—were done wrapping up their writing and miscellaneous bullshit and such and were getting ready to head out to Nick’s bar down the street to get a few beers and some food.

“You sure you don’t want to go?” one of them asked me and then asked Rob. I politely declined and they headed out.

After an hour or so the three of them came back from Nick’s and everyone was clearly drunk but not completely incoherent. More like they were pleasantly buzzed. But I barely remember them being actually being that pleasant when buzzed, lit or simply fucked up on anything.

The three of them stumbled into the office, headed over to where the offices Rob and I were in and drunkly said “Hello!” to us.

I stopped what I was doing, politely smiled and waved at them, put my headphones back on and then quickly got back to work. They then shifted their drunken welcome wagon over to Rob’s office, greeted him as they did me but then started to give him drunken grief about him not going out to drink with them.

Within seconds of them saying Rob should drink more, Todd—the alpha misanthrope of the trio—blurted out, “I mean Jews don’t drink, right?” He did it in the same jokey—yet menacing—way all of the stupid passive-aggressive nonsense came out of him. I looked at him, let the wind of that bigoted bullshit pass over me and then was ready to go back to work when his eyes shifted to me and he blurted out the same thing again, “I mean Jews don’t drink, right Jack?”

I smirked, took a deep breath, put my headphones back on and turned back to my work. This all happened in less than a few seconds but it all seemed like slow motion. Todd always had a menacing side, and we all dealt with it our own ways, but when his menacing became a literal attack the feeling was always new and befuddling.

Todd laughed a bit under his panting breath, then pulled away from hovering outside my office, straightened up his back and took a few steps back to his drunken group.

He then looked at John and Nadia, and—after a silent beat or two—Todd pulled Nadia towards him, grabs her head and pushes it into his face and aggressively kisses her; full open mouthed. She’s clearly not into it and nervously laughing and crying as his leather driving gloved hand pushes her head into his. While they were friends for years, they were never a couple and this was never expected or wanted. Nadia just went along with it and we all looked at them stunned; as if we just witnessed a car crash.

Then he pulled back—while still holding her—and shoved his hand down the front of her pants and shouted, “Look Rob! Look at what you can do to Nadia when she’s drunk!” He then went back to shoving his face back into hers; one hand still gripping behind her head and the other straight down her pants clearly feeling her up.

“Todd!” Rob blurted out from his office, as I pulled off my headphones, stood up and walked to the doorway. John—who was closer to them than Rob and—made some timid efforts to break things up by repeatedly saying, “Todd… Todd… Todd…” but didn’t do anything to really stop the attack.

Rob shouted again, “Todd!” and then he completely disengaged and physically pulled back. Nadia stood there drunkenly laughing but not much else. Nobody really did or said anything more. The laughing stopped and then everyone broke off from the group. Todd said nothing and headed outside to smoke in the stairwell as he usually did. Nadia stood around slowly coming back to normal and John did not do much of anything.

Things calmed down but the crazy incident was just as quickly forgotten as it happened. Nobody was really verbal in the post-attack moments. And nobody talked about it again.

John and Nadia left and Rob and I went back to work. I finished my work up and left.

“Goodnight Rob,” I said as I walked to the exit. He waved and went back to his work. I headed to the elevator, headed outside and headed back home.
