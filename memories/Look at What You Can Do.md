## Look at What You Can Do!

By Jack Szwergold

It was sometime in the late 1990s. Maybe 1997 or 1998. I was still living in the midwest and still working for the wacky weekly local newpaper; which was a thing back in the late 1990s.

I think it was fall or winter, but I remember it was dark and I was working late on a Friday at the publication’s office on ass end of State Street; right near the capitol and across the street from the porn shop. It was only Rob and I in the office with Rob next door in his tiny—yet powerful—“I’m the editor!” office and me in the larger production office that would usually be crammed with 3 people during most days.

Three of the old school writers—Todd, Maria and John—were done wrapping up their writing and miscellaneous bullshit and such and were getting ready to head out to Nick’s bar down the street to get a few beers and some food.

“You sure you don’t want to go?” one of them asked me and then asked Rob. I politely declined and they headed out.

After an hour or so the three of them came back from Nick’s and everyone was clearly drunk but not completely incoherent. More like pleasantly buzzed.

The three of them head over to where Rob and I are and drunkly say hello. I wave, put my headphones back on and get back to work. They shift over to Rob’s office and joke about him not going out to drink, “I mean Jews don’t drink, right?” Todd says in a jokey menacing way shifting his eyes to me and Rob while he said it.

I smirked, took a deep breath and went back to work.

Suddenly Todd grabs Maria, forces a kiss on her and shoves his hand down her pants in front of Rob’s office while I am next door in the design office. He shouted, “Look Rob! Look at what you can do to Maria when she’s drunk!”
