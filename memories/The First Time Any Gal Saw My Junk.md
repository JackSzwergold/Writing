## The First Time Any Gal Saw My Junk

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: About a time in elementary school in 1977 when two girls asked to see me and my friends junk under a cafeteria table. He stuck his thumb through the crotch of his jeans, but I just did it.

It was the fall of 1977 and every kid in the neighborhood either had seen *Star Wars* already or knew what *Star Wars* was in some way.

That sets the scene for the odd encounter I had with Lori and Lauren at the cafeteria table of P.S. 253. Me and a friend of mine were sitting at a cafeteria table in the lunch room across from Lori and Lauren. By 9 year old standards, we were flirting with them but we were all too young to really understand that.

Lauren was thumbing through a copy of *Teen Beat* magazine that featured Mark Hamill on the cover. She was a bit chubby and sleepy eyed and asked me “So, you like *Star Wars*.” To which I replied, “Yeah, I do.” She then flipped through her copy of *Teen Beat* to try and find some pictures of Mark Hamill and stuff like that.

Her pal Lori say right next to her. She had longish blonde hair that was braided on both sides and a huge honking set of braces in her mouth. Despite the fact she was an extremely slow eater—she was eating that peanut butter and jelly sandwich like sloth—she was really cute in my estimation.

When Lauren finally found some pictures in her copy of *Teen Beat* she leaned over to Lori, showed them to her and they both giggled and then showed the pictures to me and my friend.

The pictures sucked by 9 year old boy standards. They were basically the same crappy black and white promo shots of Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher you saw everywhere. A few shots were casual shots of them just walking around Hollywood or wherever, but they were just boring.
