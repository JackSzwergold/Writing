## The First Time Any Gal Saw My Junk

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: About a time in elementary school in 1977 when two girls asked to see me and my friends junk under a cafeteria table. He stuck his thumb through the crotch of his jeans, but I just did it.

It was the fall of 1977 and every kid in the neighborhood either had seen *Star Wars* already or knew what *Star Wars* was in some way.

That sets the scene for the odd encounter I had with Lori and Lauren at the cafeteria table of P.S. 253.
