# Winning the Science Fair in 5th Grade

**Quick Notes**: Later on I was doing bad in school; I forgot to do a report on Canada because the teacher would endless ply harass me. She would say things like, “Jack, I wish you would smile someday.” Which was harassment because I smiled all the time; she simply picked on me because I was somewhat of an immigrant child in the class.

Anyway, in a ham fisted attempt to rescue my education,  y brother decided to “help” me with my science fair project. So I’m was dragged to Canal Street again and he basically passive-aggressively would ask me if parts and components for a solar energy project would be a “Good idea!” Before you know it we were buying all kinds of stuff at Sylvan-Wellington in Canal Street and Cortlandt Alley; I pretty much blacked out specifics because it was so bizarre and strange to have someone 20 years older than me behave like this.

I won the science fair, but never felt 100% about it. The picture that accompanies this piece is a pic of me and my dad and brother after I received my science fair award. I always had this hanging over my desk as a kid because I thought it was a good thing. Decades later, as an adult I look at it and finally see myself scowling. The award was a lie and the experience was dysfunctional at best.
