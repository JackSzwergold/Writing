## Smashing a Car with a Baton

By Jack Szwergold

His name was Kevin. God was that guy a dick, a tool, an asshole and all of the above and then some. But most of all we at the wacky weekly newspaper knew him as our lawyer.

How he bacame the wacky weekly newspaper’s lawyer is vague but clear. It happened just before I started in the fall of 1995 and the way I understood it is he was a lawyer for a bunch of aging classic horror movie actors in Hollywood. He specialty was ambulance chasing perceived misuses of his clients name and image in many small cases. Small publications, local conventions and other similar gatherings. The works.

Technically speaking, he was acting within his—and his client’s—legal rights towards rights and fair compensation. But it was all really silly and sad when you think about it.

So anyway, prior to me coming on board the wacky weekly newspaper, they apparently used the likeness of one of his clients pictures in one of their wacky fake news articles.



**QUICK NOTES**: Sketchy lawyer at famous comedy publication. Became their lawyer after threatening to sue them over unauthorized use of image of one of his clients. He is Jewish. Found out his wife was having an affair with an Arab guy at a local hotel. Found his car outside of a hotel, used an expanding baton to smash it’s windows and dent it. Immediately called the police after the incident to tell them what he’d done. Never saw jail time but paid a reduced fine or went on some token amount probation. While he was in the midst of this, he entrusted J.K. to hold onto his guns and weapons.
