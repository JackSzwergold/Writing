## Smashing a Car with a Baton

By Jack Szwergold

His name was Kevin. God was that guy a dick, a tool, an asshole and all of the above and then some. But most of all we at the wacky weekly newspaper knew him as our lawyer.

How he bacame the wacky weekly newspaper’s lawyer is vague but clear. It happened just before I started in the fall of 1995 and the way I understood it is he was a lawyer for a bunch of aging classic horror movie actors in Hollywood. He specialty was ambulance chasing perceived misuses of his clients name and image in many small cases. Small publications, local conventions and other similar gatherings. The works.

Technically speaking, he was acting within his—and his client’s—legal rights towards rights and fair compensation. But it was all really silly and sad when you think about it.

So anyway, prior to me coming on board the wacky weekly newspaper, they apparently used the likeness of one of his clients pictures in one of their wacky fake news articles without securing proper rights and permissions. And out of nowhere, Kevin literally swooped into the newspaper’s offices and threatened to sue them out of existence. A compromise was struck where a financial settlement may or may not have been reached. But as a part of that deal, Kevin was retained as their attorney from that moment forward.

We all hated him. When he helped he helped, but by that point in the wacky newspaper’s history, anyone with common sense could have advised on rights and permission issues. But still he got paid.

And—just for context about what comes next—he was Jewish. Not like there is anything wrong with that.

So one day I came into work—maybe in 1996 or 1997—and one of my co-workers dropped a copy of the local newspaper in front of me and said, “Check this out!” His finger pointed to a small—but prominent piece—below the fold that talked about Kevin damaging some Middle Eastern guy’s car outside of a local downtown hotel.

Turns out his wife

**QUICK NOTES**: Sketchy lawyer at famous comedy publication. Became their lawyer after threatening to sue them over unauthorized use of image of one of his clients. He is Jewish. Found out his wife was having an affair with an Arab guy at a local hotel. Found his car outside of a hotel, used an expanding baton to smash it’s windows and dent it. Immediately called the police after the incident to tell them what he’d done. Never saw jail time but paid a reduced fine or went on some token amount probation. While he was in the midst of this, he entrusted J.K. to hold onto his guns and weapons.
