# Mom’s Holocaust

## Written on Mother’s Day (May 8, 2022).

They suffered from PTSD and never really talked in detail. So what I know is the timeline and not specifics. This thread is as far as my knowledge goes. Specifics are sparse.

Attached is a pic of my mom and her sister pushing a wheelbarrow in a field during this time. (1/14)

My mom was born in Skierniewice, Poland. Youngest daughter of 8 kids to a family who lived an Eastern European hick life.  My grandfather owned a donkey and a cart and sold seltzer and whatever other crap he could. They had lots of farm animals my mom enjoyed playing with. (2/14)  Nazis captured Skierniewice in Sept. 10, 1939 shortly after the invasion of Poland. When they did, the rounded up all men to send to the camps.  My grandfather went along with them since, and to paraphrase his last words to my mom, “I’ll go with them. How bad can they be?” (3/14)

He did this because when Russian pogroms happened, all men would run and hide because the Russians were known to be brutal and sadistic drunken lunatic assholes. Look what’s happening in Ukraine now? Same shit. (4/14)

So he thought the Nazis couldn’t be worse, right? Nobody knows what specifically happened to my grandfather but all agree he disappeared and died in Nazi custody. (5/14)

After a few days, nobody who knew the men the Nazis rounded up heard anything about them. Then the Nazis started to round people up in the cattle cars to either send to the Warsaw Ghetto to die slowly or just send them to the concentration camps to just murder them there. (6/14)  My mom was the youngest of the 8 and was swept up in the round up and placed in a cattle car. When it was clear by the car being packed to the gills that this was not good, my mom jumped off of the train while the train was running and ran into the woods. (7/14)

She twisted her ankle landing on the ground and had a limp her whole life because of it. She had enough mobility to run into the woods and luckily no Nazi guards shot at her. (8/14)

What happens next is vague, but at some point she regroups with her mom and her sister and they are all on the run together. How they survived? Unclear. But the Ukraine-Poland borderlands play a big role in that. (9/14)

Also the massive forests of Eastern Europe where ground troops rarely went and the biggest risk was bombing from above. Before she passed away she would talk about walking through literal minefields to get to farm houses and shacks. (10/14)  At some point while on the run from the Nazis, my grandmother contracted typhus and died in 1940. My mom and her sister took her body to the nearest town in the outskirts of Lublin (near Ukraine border) and had her buried there in a marked, but very basic gravesite. (11/14)

Slight tangent, but in the 1980s my aunt secretly went to Poland to have a real gravestone erected. She told utterly nobody and we only found out by accident. That’s PTSD for you! Keeping something as basically human as that hidden. (12/14)  Anyway, that is all there is that I know. Trying not to be too blunt on Mother’s Day, but the chances of my mom and her sister being sexually assaulted or having to trade their bodies for safety and shelter are off the charts. (13/14)

My mom suffered from PTSD, but my aunt seems to have suffered far worse and even changed her name to a Christian name as a result of the Holocaust.  
Like I said, bless them all. 

Bless them for what they experienced, for what they did and bless them for surviving. (14/14)
