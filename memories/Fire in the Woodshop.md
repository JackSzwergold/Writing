# Fire in the Woodshop

**Quick Notes**: About the time in junior high school when there was a fire in the woodshop. Smoke was in the hallways. People were not lining up properly and orderly to leave; there was just a stampede of junior high school students crushing through the side door.

When we all got out we all lined up near Sheepshead Bay on Neptune Avenue and waited. I saw the assistant principal running down the block from El Greco; a nearby diner. I started to laugh at him and he saw it.

Got in trouble because of that and had to work as an office assistant for a few months for him. Running errands and stuff. Also had to scrub graffiti off of the walls and doors; kids would come up to me and ask me why I had to do that and I just shrugged and went back to doing the scrubbing.

Found out later a friend of mine, Alex, had seen the smoke and fire in the woodshop. “Why didn’t you pull the fire alarm?” I asked him. His response, “I didn’t want to get in trouble.”
