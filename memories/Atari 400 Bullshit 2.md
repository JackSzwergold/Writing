## Atari 400 Bullshit (Part 2)
### Title says it all.

By Jack Szwergold

Weeks would pass and slowly some of my friends would end up getting computers. In retrospect, Atari was making a big “educational” push so these so-called “computers” were being marketed as a smarter alternative to video games to people. And some of those people were friends of mine.

One of the worst things about having a computer like that in the 1980s is very few stores sold software or hardware for them. I was lucky since the same Atari joysticks they used on the Atari 2600 could be used on an Atari 400—which meant I could buy replacements at local toy stores—but that was about it.

Anyway, friends if mine told me about stores in “The City” (aka: Manhattan) that sold software for Atari computers and I was excited. They told me about all kinds of cool games and stuff that were up for grabs and I wanted to check them out. So they gave me the address of one of the stores and my dad and I planned on visiting the shop.

The place was near the Empire State Building and called “The Computer Center.” The shop was small, but neat and had all kinds of different home computers on display… Including the Atari 400 and Atari 800.

Racks were filled with zip-lock backs filled with software on cassette and disk. I didn’t know what many of these games were, but I was happy to browse and see what was out there.

One game caught my eye: It was called “Baja Buggy.” It basically was an independently made clone of the Atari arcade game “Pole Position.” You drove a dirt buggy in somewhat first person point of view through a desert in some kind of race.

I wanted it, but it cost $29.99. Which was way out of the price-range of my allowance and limited savings at the time. So I looked at the package and tried to figure out how I could afford it.
