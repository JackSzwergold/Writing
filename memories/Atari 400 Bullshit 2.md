## Atari 400 Bullshit (Part 2)
### Title says it all.

By Jack Szwergold

Weeks would pass and slowly some of my friends would end up getting computers as well. It seemed weirdly coincidental at the time but, in retrospect, Atari was making a big “educational” push in the burgeoning personal computer market so these so-called “computers” were being marketed as a smarter/more thoughtful alternative to video games to the “educated” parent. And some of those people were friends of mine.

But one of the worst things about having a computer like that in the 1980s is very few retail stores sold software or hardware for them. I was lucky since the same Atari joysticks that were used on the Atari 2600 could be used on an Atari 400 and other personal computers which meant I could buy replacements at local toy stores and such. But that was about it.

Anyway, some friends of mine told me about stores in “The City” (aka: Manhattan) that sold software for Atari computers and I was excited. They told me about all kinds of cool games and stuff that were up for grabs and I wanted to check them out. So I got the address of one of the those computer stores and convinced my dad that we should plan a trip to check it out on one of his trips to “The City.”

The store was near the Empire State Building and was called “The Computer Center.” The shop was small, but neat and had all kinds of different home computers on display… Including the Atari 400 and Atari 800 as well as Apple computers and other stuff.

Instead of shelves, racks were filled with sturdy zip-lock bags filled with software on cassette and disk. I didn’t know what many of these games were, but I was happy to browse and see what was out there. And as you can tell from the zip-lock bag description, a lot of these early software companies were truly D.I.Y. affairs where one or two programmers would make a game or some other software, dupe disks and cassettes on their own, print out their own instructions, shove them in a bag and call it a day.

But amongst all of the games and such on the rack, one specific game caught my eye: It was called Baja Buggy. It basically was an independently made clone of the Atari arcade game “Pole Position.” You drove a dirt buggy in somewhat first person point of view through a desert in some kind of race.

I wanted it, but it cost $29.99. Which was way out of the price-range of my allowance and limited savings at the time. So I looked at the package and tried to figure out how I could afford it.
