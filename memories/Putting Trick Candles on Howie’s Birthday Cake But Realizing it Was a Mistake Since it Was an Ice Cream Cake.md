## Putting Trick Candles on Howie’s Birthday Cake But Realizing it Was a Mistake Since it Was an Ice Cream Cake
### About the Time I Put Trick Candle’s on a Friends Birthday Cake and Ended Up Feeling Bad About It

By Jack Szwergold

Howie was a good friend. A neighborhood friend. I didn’t go to school with him like most of the other kids I knew, but we saw each other pretty much every day in that slither of outdoor “play in the streets” time that existed between 3:00pm-ish and 6:00pm-ish each day.

It was the summer and his birthday was coming up and everyone on the block was excited. Nobody on the block ever had a big birthday party but all celebrations were special. And we were all excited to wish him a happy birthday and get am small loot bag of random crap that every parent seemed to give every kid back then.

These gift bags were small, simple and mainly filled with novleties and other junk us kids would typically get from a vending machine on the corner. But now—thanks to the celebration of someone’s something—we got to get a bag of this fun junk for free. And that’s really all us kids wanted: Free, fun junk.

One of the the things Howie and I usually did was compare notes on where we could find fun junk. Back in the 1970s, it wasn’t like you could only get toys at one special store. Tons of the cool stuff would usually be found on the racks of corner stores and delis. And past that, there was mail order.

I don’t think I was fully aware of the Johnson Smith catalog back then—a novelty catalog filled with all kinds of stuff—but we did share tips on cool stuff we saw in more commonly available items, like comics.

“Look! Trick candles!” Howie said as he showed me a page of ads in some DC comic. I have no idea what comic it was since I was mainly into “Archie” comics at the time, but that didn’t matter. What did matter was seeing that teeny, tiny ad with two distinct “before/after” illustrations: One was some kid blowing out the candles of the cake and the next were the flames of the candles just coming back to life.

“You can never blow them out!” he said. And that was cool. But none of us had the money, care or time to mail order it. For a kid, mail ordering was a whole production that often involved parents and such. And none of us had time for that.

So the dream of owning and using trick candles had to be put on hold.

Flash forward a few weeks and while out shopping with my dad around Brighton 6th Street I asked if we could stop inside of a stationery store called “Cameo” so I could see what I could see and he agreed.

I went inside and poked around to see what I could see. But it seemed like the same batch of the same old same old and such and nothing that interested me… Until I spied something on a rack, right next to piles of number candles: A pack of trick candles. I was shocked! This place had those candles? I had to score some!

So checked the price—which was about $1.50 or so—checked my pocket change and had just enough to score some.

I ran out of the store and showed the candles to my dad. He looked at the package and carefully read the writing, “‘Trick Candles?’ Why do you need this?” I just grinned and shrugged and headed back home.
