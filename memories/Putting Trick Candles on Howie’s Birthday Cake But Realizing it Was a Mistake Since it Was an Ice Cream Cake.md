## Putting Trick Candles on Howie’s Birthday Cake But Realizing it Was a Mistake Since it Was an Ice Cream Cake
### About the Time I Put Trick Candle’s on a Friends Birthday Cake and Ended Up Feeling Bad About It

By Jack Szwergold

In the 1970s, Howie was a good neighborhood friend. I didn’t go to school with him—like most of the other kids I knew at the time—but we saw each other pretty much every day during that small slide of outdoor “play in the streets” time that existed between 3:00pm-ish and 6:00pm-ish each day.

It was the summer and his birthday was coming up and everyone on the block was excited. Nobody on the block ever had a big, ovetblown birthday party but all celebrations in the neighborhood—big and small—were special. We were all excited to wish him a happy birthday and get a small “loot bag” of random fun crap that every parent seemed to give every kid back then.

These loot bags were small, simple and mainly filled with novelties and other junk us kids would typically get from a vending machine on the corner from anywhere from 5 cents to 25 cents a pop. But now—thanks to the celebration of someone’s something special event—we got to get a small bag of this fun junk for free. And that’s really all us kids wanted: Free and fun junk.

One of the the things Howie and I usually did was informslly compare notes on where we could find fun junk. Back in the 1970s, it wasn’t like you could only get toys at one special toy store. Tons of the cool stuff would usually be found on the racks of corner stores and delis. Stuff that was sold to shop owners by random door to door salesmen or local distributors dumping stuff on local stores as some kind of bonus for the owner buying a pile of something else. And past that, there was mail order.

I don’t think I was fully aware of the Johnson Smith catalog back then—a very cool and well known novelty catalog filled with all kinds of stuff—but we did share tips on cool stuff we saw in more commonly available items, like comics as well as what we spotted in local store.

“Look! Trick candles!” Howie said as he showed me a page of ads in some oddball superhero comic I wasn’t familiar with at the time. I have no idea what comic it was since I was mainly into “Archie” comics at the time, but that didn’t matter. What did matter was seeing that teeny, tiny ad with as series of distinct “before/after” illustrations: One was some kid blowing out the candles of the cake, the next the candles appeared unlit and then in the last panel—as if by magic—the flames of the candles were lit again.

“You can never blow them out!” he said. And that was cool. But none of us had the money, care or time to mail order it. For a kid, mail ordering was a whole production that often involved parents being aware of something arriving in the mail and such. And none of us had the time to deal with the domestic politics of a scene like that.

So the dream of owning and using trick candles had to be put on hold.

Flash forward a few days and while out shopping with my dad around Brighton 6th Street I asked if we could stop inside of a stationery store called “Cameo” so I could see what I could see and he agreed.

I went inside and poked around to see what I could see. But it seemed like the same batch of the same old same old and such and nothing that interested me… Until I spied something on a rack, right next to piles of number candles: A pack of trick candles. I was shocked! This place had those candles? I had to score some!

So checked the price—which was about $1.50 or so—checked my pocket change and had just enough to score some.

I ran out of the store and showed the candles to my dad. He looked at the package and carefully read the writing, “‘Trick Candles?’ Why do you need this?” I just grinned and shrugged and headed back home.

So when I got home I looked at the trick candles in their little plastic bubble, still glued to that cardboard backing paper: They looked just like normal, basic blue tiny birthday cake candles. But just a tad thicker on the wick. I wanted to try one, but was afraid I would burn down the apartment. And nobody wanted that.

Instead I thought about Howie’s birthday, and how I could surprise him with these candles we both wanted to see in action.

A few days passed and it was time for Howie’s birthday. I almost forgot about it to be honest with you until someone I was playing outside with mentioned it to me. I rushed up to my apartment, ran into my apartment, grabbed the trick candles out of my desk, shoved them in my pocket and headed outside.

My plan was to use the candles on Howie’s birthday cake. Watch him struggle to blow the candles out, and then when he was just at the edge of being frustrated, I would pull out my gift for him: The pack of remaining trick candles he wanted! What a perfect plan, right?

Anyway, so I was back outside until Howie’s mom showed up and invited us all upstairs to celebrate Howie’s birthday.

We all followed her up the stairs of the tenement up to their family’s apartment. It was like everyone else’s apartment back then: Small dinky and somewhat crammed. The cake was in the kitchen was small, dinky and crammed as well.

As everyone jockeyed for position, I was trying to figure out how to swap out the candles; which happily weren’t lit yet. I don’t recall what birthday we were celebrating at the time, but it was a good bet this was his 8th birthday. So I had to quickly swap out 8 candles.

One of our mutual neighborhood friends, Arthur, noticed me thinking a bit too much and asked what was up. I showed him the trick candles and told him what I wanted to do. “Cool!” he said. We both looked around and realized that somehow we were the only ones left alone in the kitchen. So we decided that was a sign and both scrambled to swap out the candles. It was pretty easy to do since they were placed in those small, dinky plastic holders.

Within seconds we were done, and I took the swapped out “normal” candles and shoved them into my pocket, making sure to separate them from pack of remaining trick candles I had.

Soon enough Howie’s mom and few other kids came back into the kitchen. “Shhhh…” his mom said as she started to light the candles, “We want to surprise him,” she added.

As she lit the candles, I watched them wondering how they worked. They seemed the same as regular candles even when lit, so I was extra psyched.

As she lit the last candle, we heard the front door locks on the apartment jostle and—soon enough—the front door was opened. Howie’s dad came in first followed by Howie right behind.

As his dad put bags of stuff down on the living room couch he shouted, “Howie! Check what mom made for you in the kitchen. And with that he walked in and we all shouted “Happy Birthday!”

Howie was clearly stunned and happy. He sat down at the table and looked at the cake. For all intents and purposes, the cake looked like a normal cake. But then I noticed the icing was slowly getting shinier and smoother as time passed. “Blow out the candles Howie!” his mom said, “The ice cream is going to melt!” she added.

It was an ice cream cake. And I had no idea. I never saw the box, but after she said that I looked in the trash and there it was: An empty Carvel ice cream cake box from the corner. Damn! I liked ice cream, cake and Carvel ice cream so this was going to be good.

But then as Howie started to blow at the candles, cracks in my prank plans started to show up. Yeah, Howie was getting frustrated trying to blow out the trick candles. And I carefully watched as seemingly blown out candle wicks would magically—and literally—spark back to life. So it was cool seeing how those things worked. But as Howie got more and more frustrated, the cake below was clearly melting more and more.

Was it the heat from the day? The heat from the candles? The heat from a pile of people stuck in a crammed kitchen in a badly ventilated apartment? Who knew. All I knew is the fact the candles weren’t blowing out right away on each of the many blows didn’t really help much. So I blurted out, “They’re trick candles! They won’t blow out!” And then added I’m sorry.

And with that his mom rushed over, pulled the candles out of the cake as his dad grabbed the cake to cut it up so we could all have a slice.

The ice cream icing was a bit melted, so the cake was not a complete loss. But Howie wasn’t that happy.

“Here,” I said as I handled him his gift: The pack of remaining trick candles. His face was a bit red and there were some tears near his eyes from getting upset about the candles, but he wiped them away and became focused on the candles.

“Where did you get them?” he asked. “Cameo,” I said. “Sorry about the cake I said.”

He wiped his face a bit and said, “Nah… No big deal. The cake is still good.” as he dipped his fork into the ice cream cake slice he had in front of him and put the unused trick candles back onto the table.

His parents and friends weren’t that upset. But I made note of it since it was the first prank I ever pulled on anyone.
