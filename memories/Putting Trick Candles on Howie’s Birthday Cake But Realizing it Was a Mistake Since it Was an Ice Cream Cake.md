## Putting Trick Candles on Howie’s Birthday Cake But Realizing it Was a Mistake Since it Was an Ice Cream Cake
### About the Time I Put Trick Candle’s on a Friends Birthday Cake and Ended Up Feeling Bad About It

By Jack Szwergold

Howie was a good friend. A neighborhood friend. I didn’t go to school with him like most of the other kids I knew, but we saw each other pretty much every day in that slither of outdoor “play in the streets” time that existed between 3:00pm-ish and 6:00pm-ish each day.

It was the summer and his birthday was coming up and everyone on the block was excited. Nobody on the block ever had a big birthday party but all celebrations were special. And we were all excited to wish him a happy birthday and get am small loot bag of random crap that every parent seemed to give every kid back then.

These gift bags were small, simple and mainly filled with novleties and other junk us kids would typically get from a vending machine on the corner. But now—thanks to the celebration of someone’s something—we got to get a bag of this fun junk for free.
