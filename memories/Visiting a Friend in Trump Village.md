## Visiting a Friend in Trump Village

By Jack Szwergold

I was 8 or 9 years old. It was the late-1970s. The brother of a friend of my sister was kind of a bully but the same age as me. I dealt with him mainly because when my sister would babysit me, she would essentially dump me with her friend’s brother while she went around doing other things. At this point in my childhood my sister wasn’t around, but the bully was still present in the neighborhood.

I had bought my first Star Wars action figure. A Luke Skywalker figure. And I showed it to the bully and his friend. They asked to borrow it, so I gave it to them. A few hours later they didn’t bring it back so I told my dad I was going to get it back. He was fine with that.

I found them and he invited me up to their apartment. He was obsessed with “Jaws” and kept on talking about the blood and gore. I went his room. He loved “KISS” and set fire to toys and threw them out the window. I said something about how you shouldn’t throw toys away like that; my family was poor and that was a waste of toys. Him and a friend then pinned me down on a bed, punched me repeatedly in the stomach and in my crotch. They also massaged my crotch; calling it a “dick noogie.” I was crying and upset after the assault and to shut me up they gave me some toys; some Micronauts which I liked.

I went back home and was dissociated. I got back home and tried to explain what happened to my dad. I was clearly crying. He tried to calm me down and then I remembered I left my sweater at the apartment. My older brother and his wife were there and they were obsessed with me going back alone. In their mind they saw me as too sheltered and were obsessed with separating me from my parents. I started to scream I wanted my dad to come with me, but my dad felt overwhelmed by my brother and his wife. So I calmed down, and went back on my own to get the sweater. The guy gave it back to me and laughed.

I walked back home, but was still upset. I was upset at my dad not fighting back more to help me. But when I got back home what made me more upset is my brother and his wife both smiled and were proud I went out and did something myself. I remember feeling the breath leaving my body at that moment, but no words coming out. Not only had all the adults in my life failed me, but these two hippie idiots seemed to take pride in making the sweater recovery a life lesson.

Without those two assholes, I could have convinced my dad to come with me to get the sweater back. But with their meddling and narcissistic interference, a childhood trauma was repressed because my brother was an Ivy League graduate and his wife was an education major at the Bank Street School.

Who can a kid turn too when two over educated hippie asses overwhelm common sense and reason in a family?
