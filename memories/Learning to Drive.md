# Learning to Drive

It was 1983 and as luck would have it, I was given an opportunity to learn how to drive. Well, when I say “opportunity” I meant that one of the gym teachers I had in high school let us all know he was offering driving classes to us for a nominal fee.

The teacher was Mr. Hearty. He was my gym teacher, but the day he offered us all driving classes was when he was subbing for a history teacher in school.

“If anyone wants to learn how to drive, see me after class to sign up,” he said before doing his actual teaching.

After class I walked up front and asked about the details. The deal was for a fee of $115 we would take a 6 week course and then we would be able to get a license. We could even get a learners permit to start the process.

“I have to go ask my parents,” I told Mr. Hearty as he passed the sign up sheet to me.

“Okay, here is more info,” he said while passing me a Xeroxed sheet that broke down all of the details of the course.

I walked out of the classroom and read the sheet as I headed outside and back home.

All I could think of on the way home was how to talk to my dad about this. He didn’t own a car and I had no idea how he’d react to me wanting to learn how to drive… Which in and of itself meant that I wanted to own a car.

Truth be told, I didn’t have any I’d if I even wanted a car. All I knew that if you are an American teenager, you needed to learn how to drive or else.

“Why do you want to learn how to drive?” my dad asked as he looked over the driver’s ed info sheet.

“Maybe I want to buy a car?” I responded.

“Where do you get the money for it?” he asked.

“I’ll get a job,” I responded.

And this went back and forth for a bit until my dad agreed to pay the $115 for the driving classes.￼ I filled out the form, he made out a check and then gave it to me.

Next time I was in school, I gave Mr. Hearty the filled out form and check and before you knew it I was on my way to learning how to drive.

The road to learning how to drive was to head out to some weirdo shack/storefront near John Dewey H.S. in Gravesend. While Dewey was a great school the part of Brooklyn it was in was somewhat of a dump. It was right under the elevated subway and next to it were a bunch of construction companies and related lots filled with trucks, supplies and junk. In between that stuff was a weird narrow path divided by a wire fence with razor wire on top. Walk down that path and at the end of the path was a nameless building and in there is where the driving classes happened.

Nobody really questioned why these driver’s ed classes were being held in a sketchy building that seemed to be better suited for a mob sit down and/or beat down, but no matter. We all went along with it.

**Quick Notes**:Learning how to drive with Mr. Harte in Lincoln. Parallel parking in Manhattan Beach with cops busting drag racers. Parallel parking in West Brighton near Asher Levy Park while he shooed away hookers who came near the car and got angry when they realized we were just students.
