# Learning to Drive

**Quick Notes**:Learning how to drive with Mr. Harte in Lincoln. Parallel parking in Manhattan Beach with cops busting drag racers. Parallel parking in West Brighton near Asher Levy Park while he shooed away hookers who came near the car and got angry when they realized we were just students.
