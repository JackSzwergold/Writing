# Sleeping in a Fetal Position in the Laundry Room

In the mid 1990s I moved to Madison, Wisconsin. My parents had passed away a few years earlier, my siblings were increasingly becoming born-again Jews and the prospects of being an office drone for the rest of my life weren’t appealing. I needed a break — something longer than a vacation — to clear my head. So I decided to move to Madison, Wisconsin.

Back in the 1990s, Madison was part of a group of slacker/hipster towns such as Portland and Austin. I chose Madison because I visited a few times and liked it. Cheap rent and — since it’s a college town — there were things to do.

But since I never lived there, I had no choice but to rent out a place sight unseen in the “bad” side of town. I had some money saved up and estimated I could live about a year in Madison before deciding what to do next. The place was on West Main Street and nowadays I laugh about the idea of West Main Street being “bad” but compared to the Lutheran/WASPy parts of the town it was “edgy” as the kids say.

My place was in a cinderblock equivalent of of a real world dormitory. It was filled with exchange students, high functioning adults and oddballs like me. Down the block was a medical testing facility as well as a liquor store. A happy street if there ever was one!

That said, the apartment was easily the dumpiest place I ever lived in. A true box of an apartment with a tiny kitchen and bathroom as well as a shag carpeted main room. It wasn’t much but it didn’t cost much either.

Anyway, my neighbors were weird. Especially my downstairs neighbor.

**Quick Notes**: About the time I lived on West Main Street in Madison, Wisconsin and my downstairs neighbor locked himself out of his apartment. It was freezing cold. I buzzed him in and offered to let him sleep in my hallway; the apartment was a dumpy studio apartment and the hallway was the only somewhat separated place. He declined and asked me to let him into the laundry room. He wanted to sleep on the couch, “It’s okay. I just curl into a fetal position and I’ll be fine.” So I let him in there. He just asked me to come downstairs and check on him in the morning. So I did the next morning. When I got back home that day I noticed he accidentally left some mail in my apartment when he first came up. I went to his apartment to return it, and heard some romantic music and shuffling. He came to the door and opened it. His apartment was as small as mine but he had two huge couches and a huge old school projection TV. It was very crammed and two fairly big (as in fat) women were sitting on the couch. Seems like some soft-core porn was being played on the TV. I gave him the mail, he closed the door and I went back to my day.
