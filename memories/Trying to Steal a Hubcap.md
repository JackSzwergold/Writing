# Trying to Steal a Hubcap
## About the time in 1986 when I attempted to steal a hubcap.

It was the mid 1980s. Maybe 1986 or so. For argument’s sake I’ll say it was an evening during the summer of 1986 because it was the year most everyone was graduating from high school and going off to wherever.

My main memories were of doing not much of anything more than hanging out with friends, riding my bike around Brooklyn and hanging out at various beaches around the area.

My friend Alex was still in town. He would soon be heading off to college out in the Midwest, while I was simply sleepwalking through college by going to Brooklyn College; a 4 year CUNY that was basically not much better than a 2 year school.
 
One day while lounging around at home, I got a call from Alex. “I need your help,” he said. “What happened,” I asked. “Let me pick you up and I’ll explain.”
 
So with that I headed downstairs and waited for him to show up. And in a few minutes he did in his dad’s Volvo.
 
I hopped in the front seat and we drove off.

“So what’s happening?” I asked.
 
“One of the hubcaps on the car is missing,” he said. He sounded a little nervous, but was driving cool and deliberately nonetheless.
 
We pulled onto the Belt Parkway and explained more.
 
“I don’t know when or how it happened, but one of the rear hubcaps was stolen or flew off,” he said. “Which one?” I asked and he said, “Right one.” And with that I rolled down my window and looked at the back tire. Not the greatest view but I could still see there was not much of anything there.
 
“So what do you want to do?” I asked. “You know of any places that sell Volvo hubcaps?”
 
He responded, “No. But I know where we can get one. Look on the floor.” 
 
I looked on the floor of the car and saw a crowbar and a flashlight.
 
“I’m driving to Mill Basin. We’ll find someone’s Volvo and I want you to get out and get their hubcap.”
 
I paused and basically just said, “Really?” And added “You want me to get out of the car and steal someone’s hubcap?”
 
“Yes. It’s easy,” he said.
 
“So why don’t you do it?” I asked.
 
“Because I’m the one driving,” he said.
 
And with that, we got off of the Belt Parkway around Flatbush Avenue and headed up towards Avenue U and Mill Basin.

Mill Basin was a quiet and somewhat isolated neighborhood in deep Brooklyn. It was a suburb in the classic deep Brooklyn sense that it was filled with single family homes and lawns and — because of its relative geographic isolation from public transportation and specifically the subways — it was a world on its own. A gated community without a gate.
 
We drove into Mill Basin and slowly cruised around from block to block looking for Volvos of the relatively same make and model as the Volvo Alex’s dad had.
 
It was a fairly tedious and creepy task.
 
“Maybe we should just call it a day and head home,” I said. “I mean if you told your dad what happened I’m sure it wouldn’t be a big deal?”
 
When we stopped at the next light Alex simply turned, looked at me and said, “I don’t think so.”
 
As we sat and waited for the light to change Alex spotted a Volvo parked on a nearby block.
 
“There! Look!” he said pointing to a car on the right side of the street ahead of us.
 
“Now what?” I asked.
 
“Just get out when we get near it and do it,” he said as we slowly cruised through the intersection and headed to that other, parked Volvo.

As Alex slowly drove to the car, I grabbed the crowbar and flashlight and ducked out and ran around to the other side.

It felt crazy to be doing this. I knew a lot of shady characters and lowlifes growing up in a Brooklyn but any crime past petty shoplifting was something someone else did. Not me. Won’t lie but it felt exhilarating, but also silly… Especially since I was just dressed in an outfit of an Ocean Pacific long sleeve t-shirt and shorts and Converse high tops sans socks. I was ready to go to the beach; not steal a hubcap.

Anyway, as I got to the other side of the car I flipped on the flashlight I was suddenly drowned in light… But not from my flashlight but some lights right behind me.

I turned around, saw some bright lights, hoped it wasn’t from a mob of homeowners and then just decided to bolt back to Alex’s car.

“What was that?” I asked as I settled into the passenger seat.

We both turned to look and drove off slowly. Just as we figured out what the source of the light was, it turned off.

“Do you see anybody?” Alex asked. I replied, “No.” as we drove off to the corner of the block. 

With that we circled the block and stopped at the corner. Alex said, “Get out here and just walk over and see what happens,” so I went ahead and did that: Got out of the car with the crowbar and flashlight in hand and walked over to the Volvo.

Before I even got there, floodlights from the house on the corner lit up. I stood still and waited for shouting or dog barking to pierce the quiet night, but that didn’t happen. I stood still for a while, looked for signs of life inside the house and saw utterly nothing.

After a minute or so the lights went off. So I started to walk towards the Volvo again. And after no more than two small steps, the lights went on again.

I figured it out. The lights were detecting motion. Never saw such a security device before, but what else could be happening?

I veered away from the sidewalk and walked over to Alex’s car. He rolled down the driver’s side window and asked, “What’s happening?”

“Motion defectors,” I said. “Why else would those lights be going on and off and nobody is coming out to say anything?” 

“Well, try getting that hubcap one more time,” he said.

“Really?” I asked and he simply replied, “Really.”

So without running or acting sneaky, I just walked up to that Volvo again and with a second of me just standing there the floodlights lit up the front lawn, me and the target Volvo.

I looked at Alex in the car, shrugged and he shrugged in response and with that I walked over, got into the car and with that we drove off.

Alex still insisted on looking around for another Volvo to rip a hubcap off of. Soon we found one and the second he pulled in behind it, flood lights on that house turned on as well.

“What the fuck?” he said. “Yeah,” I responded.

And with that we drove off and headed to a diner. Maybe “The Floridian” near Kings Plaza Mall or even “El Greco” in Sheepshead Bay closer to where we lived.

We sat around eating and thinking. I was enjoying my milkshake and fries and simply asked, “No what?” Alex responded, “Forget about it. Just calling it night.”

We settled the bill and just headed home sans replacement hubcap.
