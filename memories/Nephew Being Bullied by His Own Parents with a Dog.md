## Nephew Being Bullied by His Own Parents with a Dog
### About the Time My I Watched as My Nephew’s Uncle Put a Barking Akita Inches Away from the Child’s Face and All the Adults Just Laughed

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: Write about the time Matty’s brother Robert brought his dog—an Akita—over to their apartment in Brighton Beach and had it violently bark a few inches away from Etan's face. Etan was stunned, Matty and Robert were high and laughing. Tamara came out of the kitchen laughing as well. All laughing at a child being bullied by a dog. I was powerless to do anything. Rebekkah stood by stunned with tears in her eyes but not crying.

It was an odd period in the family, my sister, her husband and children moved back to Brooklyn a few years before. They lived on Ocean Avenue near Neck Road. The apartment was decent, but one day—while walking back home—my sister saw a splattering of blood on the sidewalk near a payphone on the corner and flipped out. She needed to move. Desperately.

So my father heard about this, taked to the superintendent of the building and was able to hook them up with a decent apartment in our building that was just one floor above us.

Despite the close proximity, each family kept it’s distance… For the most part… And things were seemingly decent. I could go out and play with friends in the neighborhood, and my sister and her family were not completely up our collective asses all the time.

One day I was bored and headed up to my sister’s apartment. Her husband had just come back from joggging. He was shirtless and smoking a joint as he posed my nephew on their couch for a picture.

“Hey Jack! Check this out!” he said as he waved me into the living room.

There sitting on the edge of the couch like a little doll was my nephew. He was casually—but formally—dressed up in a flannel button down shirt and my sister’s husmand was combing his hair while a joint dangled from lips.

“He looks cool, right?” he said to me, smiling with this big shit eating grin he always had on.

“I want to get a nice picture of him!” he said as he stepped back behind the 35mm camera he had on a tripod nearby.

“Come on over and looked!” he said to me as he waved me over to look through the view finder of the camera. Not much to say or see; it was just a well groomed kid as seen through the viewfinder of the camera.

I stood up and saw my niece in the corner near her room. She was shy and kind of peeking at the action as it unfolded.

“Come over!” he said to her. “Look!” he said again. And with that she quietly came over and looked through the viewfinder.

As she looked, he walked over to the stereo and put on some Rolling Stones. The specific song? “Paint It Black.”

“Hey Jack!” he said to me doing an awkward, shirtless dance as the song came on. “You know why they wrote this song?” he asked me. “Well, in the 1960s, everyone wanted to be black so that’s why they wrote a song about it.”

My sister came out of the kicthen holding a pot and asking, “What are you doing?” as she looked at all of us.

Her husband responded, “I’m just telling the kids about how we all wanted to be black in the 1960s!” She just looked at him with a “You’re crazy!” look and went on with what she was doing.

“And you know what?” he said to his son, all primed for a photo—that hasn’t been taken yet—and sitting on the couch. “Guess what! I’m not your dad! Johnny is your dad!” he said referring to the black building superintendant. “You’re black, son!” he said dancing around.

I looked around. My sister was laughing, her husband was laughing as well and dancing while he smoked his joint. I’m standing there stunned. My niece is standing there looking as if she is about to cry but not actually crying yet. Nobody knew what was happening.

Then the buzzer rang.

My sister’s husband’s brother was coming up. I heard he had a dog and broke his arm but that is all I knew about it.

Before long the bell on the door to the apartment rang, my sister opened it and there came what was ostensibly my brother-in-law with a dog that seemed like a wolf pulling him in.

The dog was an Akita and I have no idea how long he owned it, but it did not seem to want to be anywhere near him.

“Hey!” he said, “What’s up?” as the dog pulled him into the apartment.

The guy and his dog swung in to the living room at a distance and my sister’s husband and the guy started talking. Me and my neice backed off a. bit as the dog started to scope the room; it’s head twitching back and forth. My nephew sat calmly on the couch while this all happned.

Suddenly the Akita spotted my nephew and was lurching towards him and started to bark. The barks were aggresive and unfriendly and it looked like if the dog was not on a leash, it would lunch at the child at a blink of the eye.

Without batting an eye, the guy loosened the leash but still pulled back the dog. It moved closer and closer to child and kept on barking. My sister and her husband are laughing. I feel paralyzed and can see a tear roll down my nieces face.

“Look at this man!” my sister’s husband says as if allowing a dog on a leash to be near a child was the most normal thihg in the world.

“Don’t worry!” the father said as the dog barked and lunged at him. “The dog won’t hurt him. Look at him,” he said referring to my nephew, “The kid is tough as nails!”

Suddenly the dog veered a bit and almost knocked over his 35mm camera. “Whoa! Whoa!” he said as he jumped to protect his camera. “Enough already,” he said as he prodded his brother to pull the dog away.

With that, he adjsuted the camera and tripod, put his hand on his son’s head to get him to look at the camera and finally took a portrait of his son. All the while the dog still barking in the background.

I went to leave the apartment and my sister said I was welcome to come and have dinner with them shortly when it was ready. I said, “Okay…” and walked out the door, closed the door, walked down the hallway and headed back to my home.
