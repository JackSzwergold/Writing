## Nephew Being Bullied by His Own Parents with a Dog
### About the Time My I Watched as My Nephew’s Uncle Put a Barking Akita Inches Away from the Child’s Face and All the Adults Just Laughed

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: Write about the time Matty’s brother Robert brought his dog—an Akita—over to their apartment in Brighton Beach and had it violently bark a few inches away from Etan's face. Etan was stunned, Matty and Robert were high and laughing. Tamara came out of the kitchen laughing as well. All laughing at a child being bullied by a dog. I was powerless to do anything. Rebekkah stood by stunned with tears in her eyes but not crying.

It was an odd period in the family, my sister, her husband and children moved back to Brooklyn a few years before. They lived on Ocean Avenue near Neck Road. The apartment was decent, but one day—while walking back home—my sister saw a splattering of blood on the sidewalk near a payphone on the corner and flipped out. She needed to move. Desperately.

So my father heard about this, taked to the superintendent of the building and was able to hook them up with a decent apartment in our building that was just one floor above us.

Despite the close proximity, each family kept it’s distance… For the most part… And things were seemingly decent. I could go out and play with friends in the neighborhood, and my sister and her family were not completely up our collective asses all the time.

One day I was bored and headed up to my sister’s apartment. Her husband had just come back from joggging. He was shirtless and smoking a joint as he posed my nephew on their couch for a picture.
