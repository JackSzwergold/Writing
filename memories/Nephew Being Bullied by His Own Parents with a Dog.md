## Nephew Being Bullied by His Own Parents with a Dog
### About the Time My I Watched as My Nephew’s Uncle Put a Barking Akita Inches Away from the Child’s Face and All the Adults Just Laughed

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: Write about the time Matty’s brother Robert brought his dog—an Akita—over to their apartment in Brighton Beach and had it violently bark a few inches away from Etan's face. Etan was stunned, Matty and Robert were high and laughing. Tamara came out of the kitchen laughing as well. All laughing at a child being bullied by a dog. I was powerless to do anything. Rebekkah stood by stunned with tears in her eyes but not crying.
