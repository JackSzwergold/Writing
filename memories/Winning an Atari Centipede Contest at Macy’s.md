## Winning an Atari Centipede Contest at Macy’s

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: About the time in the 1980s I entered an Atari Centipede contest.

***

It was the fall of 1981 and I was flipping through the *Daily News* one  Sunday when I saw it: An ad for some kinda of “CityKids” Atari contest at *Macy’s* in Manhattan. The first prize was an Atari 400 and the second prize was Atari *Centipede* cartridge for Atari Computers.

My jaw dropped: *Centipede* was a popular arcade game, and the release of a home version was exciting. I barely had my Atari 400 for a year and was already bored with the few legal—and pirated—games I had.

I showed the ad to my dad who smiled and basically said, “That’s nice!” and agreed to take me to the contest when it happened.

I was excited and ready to share the news of this contest with friends of mine in school

So back in school, while shooting the shit with some classmates I mentioned the Atari Centipede contest at *Macy’s*. “So what?” said pretty much everything. But I didn’t flinch and responded, “I’m good at playing video games! I can win!” There was a pregnant pause and someone asked, “What if you win the Atari 400. You already have one?” Everyone nodded and I responded, “Well, I could sell it.” And this basically went on an on for a while until class started.

I sat and stared at the blank page in my notebook and started to wonder, “I never really played *Centipede* more than a few times. How can I win if I don’t practice?”

After school I went to Captain’s Quarters and decided to play some games of *Centipede*. Captain’s Quarters was a huge storefront arcade on Brighton Beach Avenue near Coney Island Avenue. As an adult it’s clear to me some shady shit happened there and it might have been a front for something. But I didn’t care. It was a well stocked and well maintained arcade in a neighborhood filled with junk stores and fruit stands.

I stuck my dollar into the change machine, got me 4 quaters and started to play.

I kinda sucked. By the time I was on my 3rd quarter, the game wasn’t fun to play.

I liked the graphics and it seemed fun, but the track ball that the game used felt awkward and I also started to realize something: A videogame for a home computer system wouldn’t use a track ball anyway. It would use that standard black Atari joystick. This kind of practice on the arcade machine would not help me.

So by the time I lost my last player on that 3rd round of *Centipede*, I just picked up my schoolbag and headed back home.

When I got home I started to think about how I could practice for the *Centipede* contest. None of the games I had at home resembled *Centipede* in any way but I had to think of something to practice so I could win.

One day, I was made a trip over to the Computer Center on 32nd Street to browse around their racks of software when I noticed something: They had an Atari 800 setup to demo a hot new game they had: *Megalegs*.

I walked over to the modest display and watched as one of the guys from the store played the game. Holy shit, it was a *Centipede* clone.

The graphics were not as good as the arcade verison of *Centipede* but the gameplay seemed 100% the same.

After the guy from the store finished playing the game I asked if I could play. “Sure,” he said as he stepped aside and passed the joystick over to me.

He hit start and I played.

I was just as bad as I was in the arcade, but I still felt like I could learn how to beat the game with the joystick.

After my round was over I picked up the zip locked bag that had the game in it and looked it over. The cover art was goofy and cool. And it was available on cassette which is what I needed since I didn’t have a disk drive at that point anyway. But what I noticed right away was the price: $29.99 or something like that.

“So you want to buy it?” the guy asked me to which I responded, “Yes. But I don’t have enough money on me.”

With that he smiled, nodded and handed me a promotional flyer for the game. I looked it over, folded it up and shoved it in my pocket and headed home.
