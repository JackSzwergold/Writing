## Winning an Atari Centipede Contest at Macy’s

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: About the time in the 1980s I entered an Atari Centipede contest.

***

It was the fall of 1981 and I was flipping through the *Daily News* one  Sunday when I saw it: An ad for some kinda of “CityKids” Atari-related contest happening at the main *Macy’s* location at 34th Street in Manhattan. And according to the ad, there were prizes to be won! The first prize was an Atari 400 and the second prize was the new Atari *Centipede* game for the Atari home computers.

My jaw dropped: *Centipede* was a really popular arcade game, and the release of a home computer version was pretty exciting. Besides, I barely had my Atari 400 for a year and was already bored with the few legal—and pirated—games I had.

I showed the ad to my dad who smiled and basically said—as enthusiastically as he could about a video game—“That’s nice!” and he agreed to take me to the contest when it happened.

Damn was I psyched about *Centipede*! And I was really excited to share the news of this Atari-related contest with friends at school.

***

So back at school—while yammering about nonsense with some classmates—I mentioned the Atari Centipede contest at *Macy’s*. There was pregnant pause and then someone just said “So what?” said pretty much everything. But I didn’t let that discourage me and responded, “Well, I’m good at playing video games… So I can win!” Then there was another pregnant pause and someone asked, “But what if you win the Atari 400. You already have one?” Everyone nodded and I responded, “Well, I could sell it.” And this seemingly endless juvenile game of “Knock him down…” basically went on an on for a while until class started.

Back in the classroom of whatever class I was in, I sat at my desk and stared at the blank page in my notebook and started to wonder, “Maybe they have something. I never really played *Centipede* more than a few times. How can I win a contest like that if I don’t practice?”

***

So after school I went to Captain’s Quarters—a local neighborhood cafe—and decided to play a few rounds of *Centipede* and see how good I was at the game.

Captain’s Quarters was a huge storefront arcade on Brighton Beach Avenue near Coney Island Avenue. As an adult it’s clear to me there had to be some shady stuff happening in there—and it might have been a front for someone or something—but I didn’t care. It was an arcade that had tons of games, was well maintained and was located conveniently near me; smack dab in the middle of a neighborhood filled with junk stores and fruit stands.

When I stepped inside of the place, I walked over to the change machine, stuck my dollar into the slot, gathered up the 4 quarters it spit back out into the tray, walked over to the *Centipede* machine and started to play.

And within less than a minute the truth was clear as day: I kinda sucked at it. The second game was slightly better, but felt like a chore more than a fun thing to do. And by the time I was on my third game, the game wasn’t fun to play.

The graphics were cool and the game seemd like it would be fun, but the track ball that the game used was awkward to used and I also started to realize something: A video game for a home computer system wouldn’t use a trackball anyway. It would use that standard black Atari joystick. So practicing on the arcade version of the game wouldn’t help me.

Which is all to say that by the time I lost my last player on that third game of *Centipede*, I just joylessly stared at the screen for a second or two, picked up my schoolbag and headed back home.

When I got home I started to think about how I could practice for the *Centipede* contest. None of the games I had at home resembled *Centipede* in any way but I had to think of something to practice on so I could get ready for the contest.

***

When the weekend hit, I was made a trip over to the Computer Center on 32nd Street in Manhattan to browse their wares when I noticed something right when I stepped in the front door: They had an Atari 800 set up to demo a “hot” new game they had: *Megalegs*.

I walked over to the well organized—but ultimately simple display—and watched as one of the guys from the store played the game. Holy shit, it *Megalegs* was a *Centipede* knock-off game!

The graphics were not as good as the arcade version of *Centipede* but the gameplay seemed 100% the same.

After the guy from the store finished playing the game I asked if I could try it out. “Sure,” he said as he stepped aside and passed the joystick over to me.

He hit the “Start” button on the Atari 800 and the game began.

Although I was just as bad at *Megalegs* as I was in the arcade when I played *Centipede*, I still felt like I could learn how to get better at playing the game when I used a joystick instead of a trackball.

After my game was over, I stepped aside and I picked up the zip locked bag that had the game in it and looked it over. The cover art was goofy and cool. And it was available on cassette which is what I needed since I didn’t have a disk drive at that point anyway. But what I noticed right away was the price: $29.99 or something like that.

“So you want to buy it?” the guy asked me to which I responded, “Yes. But I don’t have enough money on me.”

With that he smiled, nodded and handed me a promotional flyer for the game. I thanked him, looked it over, folded it up and shoved it in my jacket pocket and headed home.

I took the D train back home and got back just as the sun was setting. It was fall so the beach was empty and the breeze was calm and cool. The dusky sunlight was warm and welcoming as I walked along the elevated platform of the Ocean Parkway station to the staircase and headed downstaris to the street below.

When I got to my building, I headed upstairs and my dad immediately asked me if I wanted to eat anything, “Sure.” I said as I headed back into my room.

I took out the *Megalegs* flyer and looked it over again. Since I was just a kid with a basic allowance, I had about $8 saved up at the time. Should I hit my dad up for the rest of the money I needed to get *Megalegs*? I dunno.

“What’s that?” my dad said as he brought a plate of food to my room. “It’s a new game,” I said as I passed the flyer over to him to check out. He looked it over and said, “$29? That’s expensive!” I simply shrugged in response and left it at that.

Pretty sure my dad expected me to ask him for money to buy the game, but I didn’t ask him. Saving up money was not a strong point for me at that time and I already hit him up for advances on my allowance a lot already during the summer.

The next Monday, when I headed into school I showed the flyer to some friends. “I need to practice if I want to win that contest,” I said. And they agreed as they looked over the flyer.

“That game looks cool!” said one friend who had an Atari 800. “How about this: Let’s go 50/50 on the game,” he said. “What do you mean?” I asked. “Well, I pay $15 and you pay $15 and we can copy the game anyway so just let me have a copy.”

What a great idea! We all just learned how to pirate Atari program cassettes. So if we went in 50/50 on a game like that, one of us could keep the original game and just make a copy to give to the other person.

“Okay, but I get to keep the cassette and packaging,” I said. “Fine with me!” he said.

And with that a deal was struck.

***

After school I talked to my dad and explained the 50/50 deal. Since I already had $8, all I needed was $7 more to get the game with my friend paying the rest.

“He will pay for the rest?” my dad asked. “Sure,” I said.

And with that, my dad gave me the $7 and I headed over to my friends house to get the rest and then head into “The City” and get *Megalegs*.

***

I went to the Computer Center, bought the cassette version of *Megalegs* and they put it in a plain brown paper bag for me.

I was excited all the way home on the subway and would peek inside the brown paper bag every now and then to just look at the game.

When I got home to Ocean Parkway, I ran down the stairs, jumped the small fence near my building and headed upstairs to the family apartment.

***

I ran in the door, took off my jacket, pulled the game out of the brown paper bag, shoved it into the Atari 410 cassette drive and let it load up.

After a minute or so the game was loaded and I started to play it.

My dad came into my room to watch me play the game. “Oh, it looks good!” he said in that way parents who care—but don’t care—do.

“Yeah,” I said as I stared at the screen and played the game.

***

Soon enough, I started to play that game every day after school as if it was a homework assignment.

This went on for weeks and—in my mind—I was getting better at it with each new play.

***

Soon enough, the weekend of the Atari contest came around. I barely slept the night before, but still felt rested and excited.

“Big day!” my dad said as we both got ready to head into “The City” and enter the contest.

***

The subway trip from the ass end of Brooklyn to 34th Street in Manhattan went as it always went. Lots of waiting. Lots of sitting around and doing not much of anything. Momentary excitement as we headed over the Manhattan Bridge and then there at 34th Street we were.

We headed into Macy’s and started to look around for the contest. The ad clearly said what floor it was on, but Macy’s was a huge place.

After checking some signage and asking around we made our way up the electronics floor. We passed by this place tons of times and even checked out the video game displays they had in the past, but this contest was not on the main floor. Rather it was in a small conference room near the end of the floor.

The conference room was beige. As beige as a 1980s conference room could be. Some chairs were stacked away on the sides of the room and there were a few Atari posters on the walls. A few balloons as well. But right near the front of the room was presumably where this contest was happening. It was a setup with a few Atari computers lined up and a projector TV projecting the game onto a screen right up front.

Some people with Atari came up to us and asked us if we were there for the contest. I responded yes. They looked us over as if we were some misfit freaks. While I was 14 at the time, my dad was 63 and looked older thanks to the stresses of surviving the Holocaust and World War II. We didn’t look like father and son as much as grandfather and grandchild. “Okay, well here let me write down your name,” and with that the guy wrote down my name on some list of contest entrants. I looked at the list and it was small, but clearly had a few other entrants on it. They asked us what borough we were from and I could clearly see I was the only kid from Brooklyn; everyone else was from Manhattan.

We puttered around the conference room and I asked if we could play the game. “Sure,” the guy said and handed me a joystick.

This was the first time I was playing the actual home computer version of *Centipede* and not that *Megalegs* knock-off I had at home.

I was doing well, but not great. My idea that I could somehow practice by playing *Megalegs* was clearly not a great plan. The gameplay and patterns were clearly different despite the games visually looking similar.

But I was doing pretty well. At some point while I was playing some kid came in—presumably one of the kids I would be up against—and watched me play. “Wow!” he said. “You’re pretty good,” he added.

“Yeah,” I said to him while still in the middle of playing. “I’ve been practicing at home,” I added.

The kid gasped and said, “You cheated!” since we all knew the game was out already.

“No I didn’t. It’s this other game *Megalegs*,” I explained. And with that he and some of his friends moved aside and started talking amongst themselves.

I finished playing my practice game and scored a pretty solid score. The guy running the thing came over and said, “Wow! You’re sure to win now!” Just as my dad came by.

“You did good?” my dad asked and I pointed to the screen and showed him. “Wow! That’s pretty good,” he said as if he actually knew what a high score in *Centipede* might be but still being supportive.

Those kids who I was up against came up to the computer and started to fiddle around with it.

One of them opened up the Atari’s cartridge port to see if they could see the actual *Centipede* cartridge in it… But there was none there! I walked over as the kids quickly closed the lid and the computer booted up to the default “Atari Computer Memo Pad” application.

A woman from the Atari team came by to fix the situation. She looked around the computer and asked someone else for help. She was a bit panicked, but I could see what she was trying to do: She was trying to load the *Centipede* game from the external Atari cassette drive. I guess the cartridges weren’t manufactured yet, so this contest would be running the game from the cassette drive.

I walked over and said, “I can help.” And switched off the computer, held down the “Start” key, waited for a beep and then hit the “Return” key and the program started loading.

“I have one at home,” I told the woman from Atari. She smiled as the other guy running the thing came over, saw what was happening and said, “Yeah, the kid fixed it. We just have to wait now.”

After a while *Centipede* loaded and the guy running the competition all asked us to come up front. He basically said he would be starting the competition and it would go by the order of people on the sign-up list.

I knew I wasn’t at the top of the list, so I knew I wasn’t first. But I checked the list and there wasn’t more than one or two other people signed up after me.

I watched as other kids played. They did well, but nowhere near my score. Then one kid started playing and blew my score away. I was worried, but tried to be cool.

Soon it was my turn. I did pretty well despite my palms being incredibly sweaty and my hands shaking a bit.

When the digital dust settled my score was high, but not high enough. It was lower than my practice score and lower than that other kids, but it was still high.

The next kid bombed hard. I barely think he shot anything at all when I think of it.

The last kid was nowhere to be found. So when the dust settled, the contest was over and I was in second place! No first place, but hey… I won something!

They had me pose with the winner. It was an awkward photo at best since I was the only kid there that looked like a scrappy street kid even when I was cleaned up. The other kids were basically WASPy kids from either the Upper East Side or Upper West Side and seemed to have matching Izod Lacoste polo shirts on.

I held up my two fingers in a “V for Victory” formation and the Atari guy—who was taking pics with a Polaroid—said something like “Two fingers! For second place! Nice!”

Was a bit pissed about that but who cared.

The guy asked us for a mailing address and phone number so they could send me a *Centipede* cartridge in the mail. While I had to wait about 4-6 weeks to get the cartridge, I automatically got a dark green *Centipede* t-shirt that day just for participating as well as a copy of Kraftwerk’s “Computer World” on LP as well. He also passed along his business card as part of the whole package as well.

***

Just as we finished up, some people dressed as Pac-Man and a red ghost showed up and apparently there was a small promotional “parade” that was going to wind it’s way through the store. In my delusional enthusiasm at my winning 2nd place at the competition I thought the parade was for us kids and we could march along with them.

So me and my dad tagged along as Pac-Man and the red ghost meandered around Macy’s that afternoon.

After a while—just when it started to feel real awkward—me and my dad peeled ourselves away from the parade, headed down the escalators and headed back into the subway to go home.

***

Just after getting into the subway station, I saw a payphone and decided to call up one of my neighborhood friends (Alex) and share the good news with him.

He answered the phone, said “Hello…” and then I told him the good news: “I won second prize in that *Centipede* contest!” and without a beat he simply said, “Who cares?” and then I explained I won a *Centipede* cartridge and he said, “Okay…” and then with that I just said goodbye, hung up the phone and headed down into the subway station to head back home.

***

About 6 weeks later I asked my dad if anything came in the mail for me from Atari. “No,” he said as I went back into my room.

I looked at my calendar and 6 weeks had passed and I still didn’t get that *Centipede* cartridge in the mail. So I pulled out the business card the guy gave me at the competition and called him up. It was about 4:00pm and he was a bit tired sounding on his side of the phone.

“What?” the guy asked. “I won the *Centipede* contest a few weeks ago and I still haven’t got the cartridge in the mail.” “What’s your name?” he asked as he shuffled through some papers. I told him my name, he read off my address, I confirmed it was correct and he said he would send it off today.

A few days later the cartridge showed up in the mail. The packaging was crushed since it just shoved it in a plan manilla envelope, but the game was still good despite the manual being creased.

I popped it in my Atari 400 and started to play it. I was definitely fun, but nowhere near as fun as *Megalegs* was. The truth was I had played *Megalegs* so much since getting it *Centipede* seemed sluggish by comparison.
