## Winning an Atari Centipede Contest at Macy’s

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: About the time in the 1980s I entered an Atari Centipede contest.

***

It was the fall of 1981 and I was flipping through the *Daily News* one  Sunday when I saw it: An ad for some kinda of “CityKids” Atari contest at *Macy’s* in Manhattan. The first prize was an Atari 400 and the second prize was Atari *Centipede* cartridge for Atari Computers.

My jaw dropped: *Centipede* was a popular arcade game, and the release of a home version was exciting. I barely had my Atari 400 for a year and was already bored with the few legal—and pirated—games I had.

I showed the ad to my dad who smiled and basically said, “That’s nice!” and agreed to take me to the contest when it happened.

I was excited and ready to share the news of this contest with friends of mine in school

So back in school, while shooting the shit with some classmates I mentioned the Atari Centipede contest at *Macy’s*. “So what?” said pretty much everything. But I didn’t flinch and responded, “I’m good at playing video games! I can win!” There was a pregnant pause and someone asked, “What if you win the Atari 400. You already have one?” Everyone nodded and I responded, “Well, I could sell it.” And this basically went on an on for a while until class started.

I sat and stared at the blank page in my notebook and started to wonder, “I never really played *Centipede* more than a few times. How can I win if I don’t practice?”

After school I went to Captain’s Quarters and decided to play some games of *Centipede*. Captain’s Quarters was a huge storefront arcade on Brighton Beach Avenue near Coney Island Avenue. As an adult it’s clear to me some shady shit happened there and it might have been a front for something. But I didn’t care. It was a well stocked and well maintained arcade in a neighborhood filled with junk stores and fruit stands.
