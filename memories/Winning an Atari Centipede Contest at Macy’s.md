## Winning an Atari Centipede Contest at Macy’s

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: About the time in the 1980s I entered an Atari Centipede contest.

***

It was the fall of 1981 and I was flipping through the *Daily News* one  Sunday when I saw it: An ad for some kinda of “CityKids” Atari contest at *Macy’s* in Manhattan. The first prize was an Atari 400 and the second prize was Atari *Centipede* cartridge for Atari Computers.

My jaw dropped: *Centipede* was a popular arcade game, and the release of a home version was exciting. I barely had my Atari 400 for a year and was already bored with the few legal—and pirated—games I had.

I showed the ad to my dad who smiled and basically said, “That’s nice!” and agreed to take me to the contest when it happened.

I was excited and ready to share the news of this contest with friends of mine in school

***

So back in school, while shooting the shit with some classmates I mentioned the Atari Centipede contest at *Macy’s*. “So what?” said pretty much everything. But I didn’t flinch and responded, “I’m good at playing video games! I can win!” There was a pregnant pause and someone asked, “What if you win the Atari 400. You already have one?” Everyone nodded and I responded, “Well, I could sell it.” And this basically went on an on for a while until class started.

I sat and stared at the blank page in my notebook and started to wonder, “I never really played *Centipede* more than a few times. How can I win if I don’t practice?”

***

After school I went to Captain’s Quarters and decided to play some games of *Centipede*. Captain’s Quarters was a huge storefront arcade on Brighton Beach Avenue near Coney Island Avenue. As an adult it’s clear to me some shady shit happened there and it might have been a front for something. But I didn’t care. It was a well stocked and well maintained arcade in a neighborhood filled with junk stores and fruit stands.

I stuck my dollar into the change machine, got me 4 quarters and started to play.

I kinda sucked. By the time I was on my 3rd quarter, the game wasn’t fun to play.

I liked the graphics and it seemed fun, but the track ball that the game used felt awkward and I also started to realize something: A video game for a home computer system wouldn’t use a track ball anyway. It would use that standard black Atari joystick. This kind of practice on the arcade machine would not help me.

So by the time I lost my last player on that 3rd round of *Centipede*, I just picked up my schoolbag and headed back home.

***

When I got home I started to think about how I could practice for the *Centipede* contest. None of the games I had at home resembled *Centipede* in any way but I had to think of something to practice so I could win.

One day, I was made a trip over to the Computer Center on 32nd Street to browse around their racks of software when I noticed something: They had an Atari 800 setup to demo a hot new game they had: *Megalegs*.

I walked over to the modest display and watched as one of the guys from the store played the game. Holy shit, it was a *Centipede* clone.

The graphics were not as good as the arcade version of *Centipede* but the gameplay seemed 100% the same.

After the guy from the store finished playing the game I asked if I could play. “Sure,” he said as he stepped aside and passed the joystick over to me.

He hit start and I played.

I was just as bad as I was in the arcade, but I still felt like I could learn how to beat the game with the joystick.

After my round was over I picked up the zip locked bag that had the game in it and looked it over. The cover art was goofy and cool. And it was available on cassette which is what I needed since I didn’t have a disk drive at that point anyway. But what I noticed right away was the price: $29.99 or something like that.

“So you want to buy it?” the guy asked me to which I responded, “Yes. But I don’t have enough money on me.”

With that he smiled, nodded and handed me a promotional flyer for the game. I looked it over, folded it up and shoved it in my pocket and headed home.

***

I got back home just as the sun was setting. It was fall so the beach was empty and the breeze was refreshing. The dusky sunlight was warm and welcoming.

I headed upstairs and my dad immediately asked me if I wanted to eat anything, “Sure.” I said as I headed back into my room.

I took out the *Megalegs* flyer and looked it over. I had about $8 saved up at the time. Should I hit my dad up for the rest? I dunno.

“What is that?” my dad said as he brought a plate of food to my room. “It’s a new game,” I said as I passed the flyer over to him to check out. He looked it over and said, “$29? That’s expensive!” I simply shrugged in response and left it at that.

Pretty sure my dad expected me to ask him for money to buy the game, but I didn’t ask him. Saving up money was not a strong point for me at that time and I already hit him up for advances on my allowance a lot already during the summer.

The next Monday, when I headed into school I showed the flyer to some friends. “I need to practice if I want to win that contest,” I said. And they agreed as they looked over the flyer.

“That game looks cool!” said one friend who had an Atari 800. “How about this: Let’s go 50/50 on the game,” he said. “What do you mean?” I asked. “Well, I pay $15 and you pay $15 and we can copy the game anyway so just let me have a copy.”

What a great idea! We all just learned how to pirate Atari program cassettes. So if we went in 50/50 on a game like that, one of us could keep the original game and just make a copy to give to the other person.

“Okay, but I get to keep the cassette and packaging,” I said. “Fine with me!” he said.

And with that a deal was struck.

***

After school I talked to my dad and explained the 50/50 deal. Since I already had $8, all I needed was $7 more to get the game with my friend paying the rest.

“He will pay for the rest?” my dad asked. “Sure,” I said.

And with that, my dad gave me the $7 and I headed over to my friends house to get the rest and then head into “The City” and get *Megalegs*.

***

I went to the Computer Center, bought the cassette version of *Megalegs* and they put it in a plain brown paper bag for me.

I was excited all the way home on the subway and would peek inside the brown paper bag every now and then to just look at the game.

When I got home to Ocean Parkway, I ran down the stairs, jumped the small fence near my building and headed upstairs to the family apartment.

***

I ran in the door, took off my jacket, pulled the game out of the brown paper bag, shoved it into the Atari 410 cassette drive and let it load up.

After a minute or so the game was loaded and I started to play it.

My dad came into my room to watch me play the game. “Oh, it looks good!” he said in that way parents who care—but don’t care—do.

“Yeah,” I said as I stared at the screen and played the game.

***

Soon enough, I started to play that game every day after school as if it was a homework assignment.

This went on for weeks and—in my mind—I was getting better at it with each new play.

***

Soon enough, the weekend of the Atari contest came around. I barely slept the night before, but still felt rested and excited.

“Big day!” my dad said as we both got ready to head into “The City” and enter the contest.

***

The subway trip from the ass end of Brooklyn to 34th Street in Manhattan went as it always went. Lots of waiting. Lots of sitting around and doing not much of anything. Momentary excitement as we headed over the Manhattan Bridge and then there at 34th Street we were.

We headed into Macy’s and started to look around for the contest. The ad clearly said what floor it was on, but Macy’s was a huge place.

After checking some signage and asking around we made our way up the electronics floor. We passed by this place tons of times and even checked out the video game displays they had in the past, but this contest was not on the main floor. Rather it was in a small conference room near the end of the floor.

The conference room was beige. As beige as a 1980s conference room could be. Some chairs were stacked away on the sides of the room and there were a few Atari posters on the walls. A few balloons as well. But right near the front of the room was pressumably where this contest was happening. It was a setup with a few Atari computers lined up and a projector TV projecting the game onto a screen right up front.

Some people with Atari came up to us and asked us if we were there for the contest. I responded yes. They looked us over as if we were some misfit freaks. While I was 14 at the time, my dad was 63 and looked older thanks to the stresses of suriving the Holocaust and World War II. We didn’t look like father and son as much as grandfather and grandchild. “Okay, well here let me write down your name,” and with that the guy wrote down my name on some list of contest entrants. I looked at the list and it was small, but clearly had a few other entrants on it. They asked us what borough we were from and I could clearly see I was the only kid from Brooklyn; everyone else was from Manhattan.
