# Bag of Slugs

**Quick Notes**: About a time when some Russian guys were talking behind our building. My mom and dad noticed them and tried to figure out what they were doing from our living room window. When they left they left a small black purse. I ran down to get it. My mom and dad were screaming I shouldnâ€™t. I ran down and into the back alley, grabbed the purse and brought it upstairs. It was filled with metal, quarter shaped slugs. About $10 worth. For the next week I used them in video games and vending machines around the neighborhood.
