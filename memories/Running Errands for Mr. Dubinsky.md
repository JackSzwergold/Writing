## Running Errands for Mr. Dubinsky

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: Before I got a “real” job I ran errands for an old man in the building. He was a war veteran, lived alone and would give me $1 to buy hydrogen peroxide. Let me keep the change. His apartment was drenched in sunlight.

I was maybe 8 or 9. I didn’t necessarily want or need a job—my $2 a week allowance worked well for my needs at the time—but my dad would get me to run errands and let me keep some of the change every now and then.

Errands basically consisted of the predictable: A loaf of bread here, a container of milk there… Maybe a newspaper? Who knew. It was sporadic and mainly consisted of getting odds and ends when my parents were too tired or lazy to get them themselves.

Occasionally, though I would run errands for an old man in the building named Mr. Dubinsky. He kinda looked like my dad, but was clearly older than him. My dad—who had me when he was older—was in his 50s and I am pretty sure Mr. Dubinsky was in his late 60s when I was a kid.

I didn’t know much about Mr. Dubinsky other than I always saw him hanging out in front of the building wearing a darkish raincoat or overcoat or something like that.
