## Running Errands for Mr. Dubinsky

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: Before I got a “real” job I ran errands for an old man in the building. He was a war veteran, lived alone and would give me $1 to buy hydrogen peroxide. Let me keep the change. His apartment was drenched in sunlight.

I was maybe 8 or 9. I didn’t necessarily want or need a job—my $2 a week allowance worked well for my needs at the time—but my dad would get me to run errands and let me keep some of the change every now and then.

Errands basically consisted of the predictable: A loaf of bread here, a container of milk there… Maybe a newspaper? Who knew. It was sporadic and mainly consisted of getting odds and ends when my parents were too tired or lazy to get them themselves.

Occasionally, though I would run errands for an old man in the building named Mr. Dubinsky. He kinda looked like my dad, but was clearly older than him. My dad—who had me when he was older—was in his 50s and I am pretty sure Mr. Dubinsky was in his late 60s when I was a kid.

I didn’t know much about Mr. Dubinsky other than I always saw him hanging out in front of the building wearing a darkish raincoat or overcoat or something like that. Seemed like a decent guy. Can’t say much past that.

Occassionally at home, my dad would volunteer some trivial facts about Mr. Dubinsky seemingly out of nowhere. I don’t remember much other than Mr. Dubinsky was a war veteran of some kind. Maybe in the Polish army or some other Eastern European armed force… Definitely not the U.S. army.

Anyway, one day I was playing around in my room when my dad came in from outside and asked me if I wanted to go and run an errand for Mr. Dubinsky.

“Sure,” I said. “What should I do?” My dad came into my room, gave me one or two dollars and said, “Get a bottle of hydrogren peroxide and bring it to Mr. Dubinsky’s apartment.”

“Okay,” I said as I put on my jacket, took the money and headed outside.

I’d walk over to Speedway Drugs on the corner, meander around the toy and candy section, eventually find where those small brown bottles of hydrogen peroxide were, bring it up to the counter, pay for it and take the change and then head back into the building.

I’d buzz Mr. Dubinsky’s buzzer and he would shout “Who is it!” and I’d say “It’s Jack. I have your stuff.” Sometimes I would have to say that a few times and even shout it out. But eventually he would buzz me in and I would head upstairs.

He lived on the third floor—one flight up from my family’s place—in an apartmet that faced Ocean Parkway.
