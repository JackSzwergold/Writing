## Running Errands for Mr. Dubinsky

By Jack Szwergold

I was maybe 8 or 9. I didn’t necessarily want or need a job—my $2 a week allowance worked well for my needs at the time—but my dad would get me to run errands and let me keep some of the change every now and then.

Errands basically consisted of the predictable: A loaf of bread here, a container of milk there… Maybe a newspaper? Who knew. It was sporadic and mainly consisted of getting odds and ends when my parents were too tired or lazy to get them themselves.

Occasionally, though I would run errands for an old man in the building named Mr. Dubinsky. He kinda looked like my dad, but was clearly older than him. My dad—who had me when he was older—was in his 50s and I am pretty sure Mr. Dubinsky was in his late 60s when I was a kid.

I didn’t know much about Mr. Dubinsky other than I always saw him hanging out in front of the building wearing a darkish raincoat or overcoat or something like that. Seemed like a decent guy. Can’t say much past that.

Occasionally at home, my dad would volunteer some trivial facts about Mr. Dubinsky seemingly out of nowhere. I don’t remember much other than Mr. Dubinsky was a war veteran of some kind. Maybe in the Polish army or some other Eastern European armed force… Definitely not the U.S. army.

Anyway, one day I was playing around in my room when my dad came in from outside and asked me if I wanted to go and run an errand for Mr. Dubinsky.

“Sure,” I said. “What should I do?” My dad came into my room, gave me one or two dollars and said, “Get a bottle of hydrogen peroxide and bring it to Mr. Dubinsky’s apartment.”

“Okay,” I said as I put on my jacket, took the money and headed outside.

I’d walk over to Speedway Drugs on the corner, meander around the toy and candy section, eventually find where those small brown bottles of hydrogen peroxide were, bring it up to the counter, pay for it and take the change and then head back into the building.

I’d buzz Mr. Dubinsky’s buzzer and he would shout “Who is it!” and I’d say “It’s Jack. I have your stuff.” Sometimes I would have to say that a few times and even shout it out. But eventually he would buzz me in and I would head upstairs.

He lived on the third floor—one flight up from my family’s place—in an apartment that faced Ocean Parkway. Once I got to his hallway you could even see the light from the peephole flicker as he looked down to the hallway to see if it was me.

Then when I got to the door, he’d open up the door, and let me into his apartment.

The apartment was sparse and barely furnished. There was pretty much no carpeting and just a small rug near his bed; the floors were exposed hardwood and worn out in spots. A few pots, pans plates could be spotted in the kitchen near the doorway and a few token pictures on the wall and maybe one dresser, one bed and a few chairs could be spotted in the main part of the apartment. From my recollections, pretty much all of what he owned could probably shoved into one medium sized suitcase; the rest could easily have been abandoned and tossed in the trash. Clearly nobody else lived with him.

I’d give him the paper bag that had the hydrogen peroxide and the change. He would look over the contents of the bag, the receipt inside and count the change and then give me back the bulk of the change.

“Thank you,” he would say with a thick European accent has he handed me a small pile of coins as we both walked back to the front door.

While Mr. Dubinsky didn’t have much in his apartment, I was blown away by his view. The apartment was facing Ocean Parkway and the windows faced the west so the place was always sun drenched.

I’d run a few errands over the next few months on an off for Mr. Dubinsky, but eventually they stopped. I didn’t know what happened, but months later my dad mentioned in passing that Mr. Dubinsky had died.

No great fanfare or sadness. He was just dead and his apartment was rented out to someone else.
