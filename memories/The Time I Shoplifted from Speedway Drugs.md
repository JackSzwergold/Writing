## The Time I Shoplifted from Speedway Drugs
### About the Time I Shoplifted Some Civil War from the Corner Drugstore

By Jack Szwergold

**Quick Notes**: It was two sets of Civil War rack toy figures. Shoved them under my shirt and snuck out the back door.

It was another boring day and it was 1975 or 1976 and I was doing what I usually did: Play with neighborhood kids with occassional breaks to do something else.

On this day I was playing in front of Speedway Drugs on Ocean Parkway, right next to my building. It was bright, sunny and the air was fresh with the smell of cut grass in front of my buiding thanks to Johnny and his hand mower.
