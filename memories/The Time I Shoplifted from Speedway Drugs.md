## The Time I Shoplifted from Speedway Drugs
### About the Time I Shoplifted Some Civil War from the Corner Drugstore

By Jack Szwergold

**Quick Notes**: It was two sets of Civil War rack toy figures. Shoved them under my shirt and snuck out the back door.

It was another boring day and it was 1975 or 1976 and I was doing what I usually did: Play with neighborhood kids with occassional breaks to do something else.

On this day I was playing in front of Speedway Drugs on Ocean Parkway, right next to my building. It was bright, sunny and the air was fresh with the smell of cut grass in front of my buiding thanks to Johnny and his hand mower.

At some point I decided to go into Speedway Drugs to cool off and browse the toy rack.

I walked inside and waved to Jack the pharmacist. I was really proud to have the same name as someone as important as the pharmacist at the local drug store.

I walked up to the toy aisle and checked out the rack. They always had a decent selection of cheap stuff. And today, I spotted something right up my alley: Some Civil War toy soldiers. One pack of Union soldiers and another pack of Confederate soldiers.

Now I wasn’t some kind of Civil War nut as a kid, but these figures looked cool. Unlike classic old green toy soldiers, these soldiers were made up multiple pieces of differently colored plastic. Some parts were flesh colored, others were navy blue or light grey with some parts dark green or dark brown. Damn, I wanted them! But they were like $2.99 per pack and I had nothing saved up in my allowance to cover that. And besides, if I got a set of Union soliders I would need to get another set of Confederate soldiers, right?

So I walked back to the front of the store, looked over the selection in the vending machines near the entrance and dejectedly walked back out into the afternoon sun.

When I walked outside I saw some neighborhood kid. Honestly don’t remember who, but they asked me what I got from the store. I mean, if you went into a store it was to get something right?

“Nothing,” I said. “Why?” the kid asked. “I don’t have enough money,” I said. “So what?” he responded.

We then walked a bit down the side of Speedway and he pointed to the side door.

“So what?” I said.

“You never went in to the store that way?” he asked and I shook my head “No…”

“Look, you can go into the store in the front and then shove stuff under your shirt and leave that way,” he said looking at me with this “You know what I mean?” look on his face.

I knew what he meant. But that was stealing and that was wrong so I asked, “But that’s stealing?” and he responded, “So what?” with a confident shrug.

We were both kids and I guess this was my introduction to shoplifting. So I asked, “What if I get caught? I don’t want to get in trouble.

“Don’t worry!” he said. “Let’s just go in,” he added.

So with that we both walked into the store together.

I was a little tense and my palms were sweaty, but he seemed cool.

I walked up to the toy rack and showed him the Civil War figures. “They look cool!” he said. Then he moved around from one side of me to another and said, “You first.” I looked at him, looked at Jack behind the counter not looking at us and then looked at the toys.

I pulled out the front of my shirt and shoved one pack of Civil War soliders under my shirt and tried to hold it inconspiculously as if it wasn’t there. he grabbed another set and did the same.

We both then slowly walked to the side door. I opened it up, he followed. The afternoon sun hit as and as the door swung closed we ran down towards my building and lept over the small brick wall, down the slight alley where they made oil deliveries and into the building lobby.

I pulled out the pack of soliders I had under my shirt and he pulled the pack he had and gave it to me.

“Wow!” I said, “We did it!” I added. “See!” he said, “No problem!” he added.

I gave him a high five and he went back outside to play with other kids. I felt like I owed him something, but he seemed like a pro at this kinda stuff so he just smiled and didn’t say much more or ask for anything. He was simply sharing some knowledge he had with me.

I buzzed the buzzer and my dad let me in. I completely forgot that I had the packs of toys in my hand as I went through the front door.

“What are those?” my dad asked. “Where did you get them?” he added. I stood their and paused for a second and said, “I got them from some friends,” I said. “I traded some stuff for them,” I added.

He looked at me and accepted what I said at face value but was clearly not that convinced. But he didn’t take them away from me.

I headed into my room, opened up the packages and played with them. They weren’t the greatest toys in the world, but they were really cool to look at. Before you knew it I had some Civil War action happening on my floor.

Later that evening, my dad came into my room to give me dinner and asked again, “Friends gave those to you?” he asked. And I said, “I traded for them.” And he again accepted what I said but seemed sceptical.

I stood up to eat but also put the soldiers out on my desk and put them on display with some of the other stuff I had on my desk.

The next day I woke up and it was a seemingly normal day. My dad was up earlier than me and was out shopping and I was putzing around my room.

I played around with those Civil War figures some more when I started to get bored and decided I should just go outside and do something.

So I ran downstairs, me up with some neighborhood kids and then played around
