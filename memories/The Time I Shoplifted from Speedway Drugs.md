## The Time I Shoplifted from Speedway Drugs
### About the Time I Shoplifted Some Civil War from the Corner Drugstore

By Jack Szwergold

**Quick Notes**: It was two sets of Civil War rack toy figures. Shoved them under my shirt and snuck out the back door.

It was another boring day and it was 1975 or 1976 and I was doing what I usually did: Play with neighborhood kids with occassional breaks to do something else.

On this day I was playing in front of Speedway Drugs on Ocean Parkway, right next to my building. It was bright, sunny and the air was fresh with the smell of cut grass in front of my buiding thanks to Johnny and his hand mower.

At some point I decided to go into Speedway Drugs to cool off and browse the toy rack.

I walked inside and waved to Jack the pharmacist. I was really proud to have the same name as someone as important as the pharmacist at the local drug store.

I walked up to the toy aisle and checked out the rack. They always had a decent selection of cheap stuff. And today, I spotted something right up my alley: Some Civil War toy soldiers. One pack of Union soldiers and another pack of Confederate soldiers.

Now I wasn’t some kind of Civil War nut as a kid, but these figures looked cool. Unlike classic old green toy soldiers, these soldiers were made up multiple pieces of differently colored plastic. Some parts were flesh colored, others were navy blue or light grey with some parts dark green or dark brown. Damn, I wanted them! But they were like $2.99 per pack and I had nothing saved up in my allowance to cover that. And besides, if I got a set of Union soliders I would need to get another set of Confederate soldiers, right?

So I walked back to the front of the store, looked over the selection in the vending machines near the entrance and dejectedly walked back out into the afternoon sun.

When I walked outside I saw some neighborhood kid. Honestly don’t remember who, but they asked me what I got from the store. I mean, if you went into a store it was to get something right?

“Nothing,” I said. “Why?” the kid asked. “I don’t have enough money,” I said. “So what?” he responded.

We then walked a bit down the side of Speedway and he pointed to the side door.

“So what?” I said.

“You never went in to the store that way?” he asked and I shook my head “No…”

“Look, you can go into the store in the front and then shove stuff under your shirt and leave that way,” he said looking at me with this “You know what I mean?” look on his face.

I knew what he meant. But that was stealing and that was wrong so I asked, “But that’s stealing?” and he responded, “So what?” with a confident shrug.

We were both kids and I guess this was my introduction to shoplifting.
