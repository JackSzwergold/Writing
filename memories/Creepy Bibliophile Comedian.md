## Creepy Bibliophile Comedian

By Jack Szwergold

The first time I met John people told me how he had previously headed to New York City to make it big at MTV or Comedy Central. He’s one of the few people from that newspaper who decided it was time for him to take the show on the road and “make it” (whatever that means) in New York City by moving his whole life out there based on some spec freelance work and not much else.

Apparently since I was born—and lived—in New York City around the same time he was there trying to “make it” (whatever that means) some thought that would somehow translate into somehow us knowing each other. And honestly I didn’t know him from a hole in the ground but he seemed like a nice guy… At least from what I had heard about him. And in pictures that were shared with me he seemed like an innocuous, *Devo*-loving Midwestern hipster.

Then I actually met him.

I’ll leave a lot of the hyper-specific, niggly details of his personality for some other piece. But at the end of the day John was basically Midwestern passive aggressive weirdo writer wannabe at best who most of the time was really just an erudite hipster alcoholic and not much else.

I mean, I was able to get along with him when I could. But the times his bitterness and resentment about failing as a New York City creative—and having to head back home to Madison, Wisconsin—popped up I could barely breathe in the same space he took up. Those were the times I suddenly became a target for some of his misguided, prejudicial self-centered bullshit.

So on to the rest of teh story as I know it.

***

While John was married, at one point he was separated from his wife.

His wife was nice, cuet, cool and pleasant but was a tad robotic. She was kind of a hipster “Stepford Wife” in many respects. John was passive aggressive—and sometimes just straight out aggressive—and the drinking didn’t temper these tendencies. And oh yeah, while they were married they were supposedly in an “open relationship.” Which—as most of us who knew John knew—practically meant he just screwed around on her impulsively all the time and she simply sat at home alone and dealt with it.

From what we could gather about their separation, she moved out of their apartment and was now sharing a place with some other guy on the other side of town. There was no romantic involvement with the other guy; he was just a roommate and that was that.

John still lived in their old place—where he mainly sat around, dranked and played PLayStation games when he was writing—and that was that.

While Madison, Wisconsin was a decent sized city, it was still a small town in many ways. And you would randomly run into people out on the street more often that you would elsewhere.

In the case of John, I spotted him out on the street every now and then. Mostly at bars or just wandering about State Street. But during his separation from his wife, I would often see him hanging out at this bookstore right across the street from the newspaper’s offices.

I knew he liked books—and there’s nothing wrong with liking books—but he would often be in that bookstore for hours on end just hanging out with the owner of the place.

On a few occasions I witnessed some weirdness: Namely, the owner of the bookstore crossing the street to head to a nearby bar with John trailing behind him literally like some puppy dog. I mean the look on his face literally looked like a gobsmacked puppy—or a brainwashed cult member—when I spotted him trailing this guy. And don’t get me wrong, I would even attempt to say “Hi!” to him but it was like he was in some other mental state or just on some other planet altogether.

More than a few times during this specific period he’d miss some weekly staff meetings while hanging out with that bookstore owner. His absence was noticed—and the staff would speak out about it—but since he was an old school staff writer they let these absences slide. And he would often show up near the end of a meeting—or sometimes even the next day—apologizing about missing a meeting but still somehow hand in his work work as assigned. 

***

While these absences were sporadic, there was a small span of a week or two where literally nobody heard from John at all. Which was weird. He really didn’t have a job past working in the local liquor store and writing for the newspaper, so him just disappearing like that was unexpected.

Just as we were all on the edge of thinking something horrible happened to him, he mysteriously showed up at the offices again.

He sat down at the weekly meeting and let us know what happened: He was picked up by local cops who were questioning him about the sudden death of his wife’s roommate.

Without missing a beat John explained to us what happened: Apparently the his wife’s roommate died suddenly from a drinking a mixture of sleeping pills and alcohol and he was being questioned as a suspect. But while that was a description of a crime he was suspected of committing, that wasn’t the actual reason he was out of touch with us. That was simply something that happened while he was away doing something else.

John’s story—to us and the cops—was that he went to some book fair with the owner of the bookshop across the street from the newspaper during the time that guy died. So it was not possible for him to have been around when his wife’s roommate apparently committed suicide.

We knew John liked books, but he never told us about going to any book fairs. Nor did any of us—at the newspaper or the liquor store he worked at—knew that he took off for a few weeks to go to a book fair. I mean the guy simply disappeared from two of his jobs… To go to a book fair? Who does that?

But apparently the cops accepted that alibi and John was no longer a suspect in someone’s death and life went on.

***

A few weeks later John’s ex-wife had moved back in with him. When I talked to her at some small gathering she repeated some variant of the same story John pushed on us: Her roommate was depressed and glum all the time she lived with him so the fact he died suddenly like that didn’t surprise her.

But it was hard to shake the impression—as she told me that story—that she was secretly, non-verbally stating, “And you believe that, right?”

I didn’t really believe any of it to be honest. But I didn’t know what to say, or who to say it to or what difference it would make at that moment. Who was I to judge? John and his wife were back together and her former roommate was dead and that is what that was then, now and always.
