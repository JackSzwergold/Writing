## Creepy Bibliophile Comedian

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: Writer at a famous comedy publication. Sibling suffers from some kind of retardation. History of abuse with his wife. When his wife separated, she moved in with a male roommate. He makes mysterious trip to some “book show” out of nowhere. During that trip wife’s roommate suddenly dies from alcohol and pill overdose. Police question him but the “book show” was his alibi. He gets off.

The first time I met John people told me how he had previously headed to New York City to make it big at MTV or Comedy Central. He’s one of the few people from that newspaper who decided it was time for him to take the show on the road and “make it” (whatever that means) in New York City by moving his whole life out there based on some spec freelance work and not much else.

Apparently since I was in New York around the same time he was we somehow would have known each other. I honestly didn’t know him from a hole in the ground but he seemed like a nice guy… At least from what I heard about him. And in pictures he seemed like an innocuous, *Devo*-loving hipster.

Then I met him.

I’ll leave lots of the weedy details for some other piece, but at the end of the day John was some weird midwestern passive aggressive writer wannabe who was really just a hipster drunk at best.

I got along with him when I could, but the times his bitterness about failing in New York—and having to head back to Madison, Wisconsin—popped up I suddenly became a target for some of his misguided, prejudicial self-centered bullshit.

While John was married, at one point he was separated from his wife.

His wife was nice, but a tad robotic. John was passive aggressive—and sometimes just straight out aggressive—and a bit of a drunk. And oh yeah, while they were married they were supposedly in an “open relationship.” Which practically meant he screwed around on her and she simply sat at home and dealt with it.

From what we could gather about this separation, she moved out of their apartment and was now sharing a place with some other guy. There was no romantic involvement with the other guy; he was just a roommate.

John still lived in their old place and that was that.

While Madison was a decent sized city, it was still a small town in some ways. And you would run into people out on the street fairly regularly.

In the case of John, I spotted him out on the street every now and then. Mostly at bars or just wandering about. But during this separation, I would often see him at this bookstore right across the street from the newspaper’s offices.

I knew he liked books, but he would often be in that bookstore for hours on end hanging out with the owner of the place.

On a few occasions I witnessed some weirdness: Namely, the owner of the bookstore crossing the street to head to a nearby bar with John trailing behind him literally like some puppy dog. I mean the look on his face literally looked like a gobsmacked puppy when I spotted him like this. And I would even try to say “Hi!” but it was like he was on another planet.

More than a few times he’d miss weekly staff meetings while hanging out with the bookstore owner. Everyone notice, and our editors would comment about his absence, but since he was an old school writer they let it slide. And he would often show up after the meeting—or the next day—apologizing for his absence and handing in work as assigned.

***

While these absences were sporadic, there was a small span of a week or two where literally nobody heard from John at all. Which was weird. He really didn’t have a job past working in the local liquor store and writing for the newspaper, so him just disappearing like that was unexpected.

Just as we were all on the edge of thinking something horrible happened to him, he mysteriously showed up at the offices again.

He sat down at the weekly meeting and let us know what happened: He was picked up by local cops who were questioning him about the sudden death of his wife’s roommate.

Without missing a beat John explained to us what happened: Apparently the his wife’s roommate died suddenly from a drinking a mixture of sleeping pills and alcohol and he was being questioned as a suspect. But while that was a description of a crime he was suspected of committing, that wasn’t the actual reason he was out of touch with us. That was simply something that happened while he was away doing something else.

John’s story—to us and the cops—was that he went to some book fair with the owner of the bookshop across the street from the newspaper during the time that guy died. So it was not possible for him to have been around when his wife’s roommate apparently committed suicide.

We knew John liked books, but he never told us about going to any book fairs. Nor did any of us—at the newspaper or the liquor store he worked at—knew that he took off for a few weeks to go to a book fair. I mean the guy simply disappeared from two of his jobs… To go to a book fair? Who does that?

But apparently the cops accepted that alibi and John was no longer a suspect in someone’s death and life went on.

***

A few weeks later John’s ex-wife had moved back in with him. When I talked to her at some small gathering she repeated some variant of the same story John pushed on us: Her roommate was depressed and glum all the time she lived with him so the fact he died suddenly like that didn’t surprise her.

But it was hard to shake the impression—as she told me that story—that she was secretly, non-verbally stating, “And you believe that, right?”

I didn’t really believe any of it to be honest. But I didn’t know what to say, or who to say it to or what difference it would make at that moment. Who was I to judge? John and his wife were back together and her former roommate was dead and that is what that was then, now and always.
