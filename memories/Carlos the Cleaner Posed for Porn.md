## Carlos the Cleaner Posed for Porn

By Jack Szwergold

I worked for a comic book company back in the late 1980s. I wasn’t an artist or anything, but I was basically a “worker” wokring in the shipping department, taking orders, doing data entry, and all that.

And the company itself was a boutique business run out of a loft on 19th Street in the Flatiron district. One half of the loft was an illustration business, ther other half was a graphic novel business. The two guys who ran the place lived in the back of the loft.

I got hooked up with the gig after writing for a summer job at another boutique comic book publisher called Rough Books. They were well known and one of the main guys at the place gained some fame writing a comic book about his family’s experience during the Holocaust. And knowing that, I wrote to them, explained my interest in comics as well as my family’s connection to the Holocaust, and asked for a summer job. They responded and I got a “job” at the place.

**QUICK NOTES**: About a co-worker at Castilian Communications who mainly cleaned the place was obsessed with proving to us he posed in a porn magazine. He liked to make chicken and rice and would come over to me and say, “It’s better than pussy, right Jack?”
