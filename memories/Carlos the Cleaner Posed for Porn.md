## Carlos the Cleaner Posed for Porn

By Jack Szwergold

I worked for a comic book company back in the late 1980s. I wasn’t an artist or anything, but I was basically a “worker” wokring in the shipping department, taking orders, doing data entry, and all that.

And the company itself was a boutique business run out of a loft on 19th Street in the Flatiron district.

**QUICK NOTES**: About a co-worker at Castilian Communications who mainly cleaned the place was obsessed with proving to us he posed in a porn magazine. He liked to make chicken and rice and would come over to me and say, “It’s better than pussy, right Jack?”
