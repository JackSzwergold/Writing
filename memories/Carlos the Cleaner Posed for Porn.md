## Carlos the Cleaner Posed for Porn

By Jack Szwergold

I worked for a comic book company called Castilian Communications back in the late 1980s. I wasn’t an artist or anything, but I was basically a “worker” working in the shipping department, taking orders, doing data entry, and all that.

And the company itself was a boutique business run out of a loft on 19th Street in the Flatiron district. One half of the loft was an illustration business, the other half was a graphic novel business. The two guys who ran the place lived in the back of the loft.

I got hooked up with the gig after writing for a summer job at another boutique comic book publisher called Rough Books. They were well known and one of the main guys at the place gained some fame writing a comic book about his family’s experience during the Holocaust. And knowing that, I wrote to them, explained my interest in comics as well as my family’s connection to the Holocaust, and asked for a summer job. They responded and I got a “job” at the place.

But it turned out to be just a shitty internship doing things I wasn’t really interested in for barely any salary whatsoever. Yeah, as an adult now I understand the value of a real internship. But back then I just wanted a job at a cool place and—most of all—to get paid in the process.

I generally didn’t get along with anyone there. Especially when the main “gofer” at the place—this guy named Rob—would delay paying me every week as he promised. It was my first introduction to the art and publishing world, but I wasn’t really ready for it.

So after a few weeks of making maybe $80 total, Rob called me and said there was a job more up my alley at this place called Castilian Communications. I never heard of them before, but it sounded more like a real job. So I called them up, met the owner, we got along and I got a summer job in “the city.”

So anyway, the job at Castilian Communications was pretty cool for a summer job. I unloaded trucks, filled orders, responded to customer inquiries/complaints, went to the bank, went to the post office and all of that stuff.

But the thing is the place wasn’t really an office or a real workplace. It was like a huge home office that I happened to work in so things got oddly casual at times.

Like whenever Carlos—the cleaning guy—would do pretty much anything.

Carlos was Puerto Rican and proud. Was short, wore a cap with the Puerto Rican flag on it and had a huge mustache that made him look like John Oates from *Hall and Oates*. He was cool, but he’d needle you a bit just for fun. And he liked needling me a lot because as some deep Brooklyn white guy working in the Flatiron I was kinda “redneck” compared to them.

When he cooked for us that was a genuine treat. It was an all day affair. I would get in at 10:00am and he would already be cooking a huge pot of rice, beans and chicken. The rice was done quickly and would just sit there. The beans and chicken? He’d babysit them all day so he could serve it to us around 4:00pm or 5:00pm.

“You’re gonna like it, Jack,” he’d pester me all day saying. “It tastes better than pussy Jack. I assure you,” he’d add.

Some days I just grinned and bore it. Just humoring him and nodding in agreement as I walked around the office. Other days I would avoid him which was surprisingly easy given the size of the loft. In general, I was cool with it.

Then when the time came for him to serve the food, he would make sure to remind me the chicken tasted better than pussy by repeatedly saying to me “Jack, you’re gonna love it. It tastes better than pussy, believe me!”

And you know what? The chicken tasted really good. Was it better than pussy? I don’t know know if that is a comparison that respects the chicken or pussy in a fair way, but it was decent chicken.

Then one day after one of these meals, Carlos got into one of his sporadic fights with the head guy at Castilian Communications. I think it was over pay or something. Maybe money owed for other stuff? Who knows. But when these fights happened, we all cleared out and headed back to our humble little desk area.

And that’s where we waited for the Carlos’ post fight venting.

What would happen is Carlos and the owner would fight. The owner would go off somewhere and Carlos would then be flustered, paced around the office and then would come back to our humble little desk area to vent.

“He’s bullshit man!” he would say. “I do a ton of work here and he treats me like shit,” he would add. “I’m gonna quit, man, and let him learn,” and so on and so on.

This was all predictable and would usually blow over in 10 to 15 minutes. But when it happened at the end of the day it was extra annoying. Nobody wanted to leave in the middle of one of his rants and somehow—inadvertently—disrespect him. And it was the end of the day and we all wanted to go home after eating that delicious “better than pussy” chicken he made for us.

But this time he added something new to his rant, “You know, I was famous once. I posed for porn magazines!” Which was a new one so we all instantly said, “Really?” and he responded, “You don’t believe me? I did!”

Somehow he interpreted us questioning his porn career as some kind of personal slight. “Really? Really? That is what you think?” he would say all nervous. “Well fuck you! Fuck you Jack! Fuck you Miguel! Fuck you Shannon!” he screamed at us. “Just you wait! I’lll show you!” he said as he stormed off, got to the elevator and shouted a final “Fuck you!” to all of us as he headed out.

We all looked at each other stunned, chatted a bit about Carlos and then we all headed home.

The next day I came in a little late, but when I arrived it seemed like another boring day at the boutique loft office when suddenly Miguel nervously said to me, “Carlos brought in one of the porn magazines he was in.”

As I put down my bag I said, “Really?” and with that Miguel turned around and passed me a manilla office folder. I opened it up and inside of it was some kind of male porno mag—*Cavalier* or something like that—and there on the cover was a shirtless, hairy and ripped Carlos in all of his glory. His jeans were open, but that was about it for the cover.

“Wow!” I said, as I closed the folder up again and passed it back to Miguel. “No! No! Jack you are missing the best part,” he said as he opened it up, flipped some pages and passed it back to me.

As I took the magazine in my hand, I looked at the page Miguel opened it to and there was a full spread featuring Carlos. And wow, the guy was hung.

“It’s like down to his knee?” I said as I looked at it.

“Yup!” Miguel said.

I stared at it a bit and looked around and asked “Where’s Carlos?” Miguel responded “He’s running some errands. But we can’t let the boss see it.”

It wasn’t like the boss was homophobic or a prude or anything—far from either to be honest—but Carlos just never let the boss see any of the shots from his brief stint as a male porn model.

With that I passed the magazine back to to Miguel who slipped it back into the pile of stuff on the shelf behind him and we all got back to doing whatever we were doing that day.
