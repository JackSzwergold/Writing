## Carlos the Cleaner Posed for Porn

By Jack Szwergold

I worked for a comic book company called Castilian Communications back in the late 1980s. I wasn’t an artist or anything, but I was basically a “worker” working in the shipping department, taking orders, doing data entry, and all that.

And the company itself was a boutique business run out of a loft on 19th Street in the Flatiron district. One half of the loft was an illustration business, the other half was a graphic novel business. The two guys who ran the place lived in the back of the loft.

I got hooked up with the gig after writing for a summer job at another boutique comic book publisher called Rough Books. They were well known and one of the main guys at the place gained some fame writing a comic book about his family’s experience during the Holocaust. And knowing that, I wrote to them, explained my interest in comics as well as my family’s connection to the Holocaust, and asked for a summer job. They responded and I got a “job” at the place.

But it turned out to be just a shitty internship doing things I wasn’t really interested in for barely any salary whatsoever. Yeah, as an adult now I understand the value of a real internship. But back then I just wanted a job at a cool place and—most of all—to get paid in the process.

I generally didn’t get along with anyone there. Especially when the main “gofer” at the place—this guy named Rob—would delay paying me every week as he promised. It was my first introduction to the art and publishing world, but I wasn’t really ready for it.

So after a few weeks of making maybe $80 total, Rob called me and said there was a job more up my alley at this place called Castilian Communications. I never heard of them before, but it sounded more like a real job. So I called them up, met the owner, we got along and I got a summer job in “the city.”

So anyway, the job at Castilian Communications was pretty cool for a summer job. I unloaded trucks, filled orders, responded to customer inquiries/complaints, went to the bank, went to the post office and all of that stuff.

But the thing is the place wasn’t really an office or a real workplace. It was like a huge home office that I happened to work in so things got oddly casual at times.

Like whenever Carlos—the cleaning guy—would do pretty much anything.

Carlos was Puerto Rican and proud. Was short, wore a cap with the Puerto Rican flag on it and had a huge moustache that made him look like John Oates from *Hall and Oates*. He was cool, but he’d needle you a bit just for fun. And he liked needling me a lot because as some deep Brooklyn white guy working in the Flatiron I was kinda “redneck” compared to them.

When he cooked for us that was a genuine treat. It was an all day affair. I would get in at 10:00am and he would already be cooking a huge pot of rice, beans and chicken. The rice was done quickly and would just sit there. The beans and chicken? He’d babysit them all day so he could serve it to us around 4:00pm or 5:00pm.

“You’re gonna like it, Jack,” he’d pester me all day saying. “It tastes better than pussy Jack. I assure you,” he’d add.

Some days I just grinned and beared it. Just humoring him and nodding in agreement as I walked around the office. Other days I would avoid him which was suprisingly easy given the size of the loft. In general, I was cool with it.

Then when the time came for him to serve the food, he would make sure to remind me the chicken tasted better than pussy by repeatedly saying to me “Jack, you’re gonna love it. It tastes better than pussy, believe me!”

And you know what? The chicken tasted really good. Was it better than pussy? I don’t know know if that is a comparison that respects the chicken or pussy in a fair way, but it was decent chicken.

Then one day after one of these meals, Carlos got into one of his sporadic fights with the head guy at Castilian Communications. I think it was over pay or something. Maybe money owed for other stuff? Who knows. But when these fights happened, we all cleared out and headed back to our humble desk area.
