## Atari 400 Bullshit (Part 3)
### Title says it all.

By Jack Szwergold

Weeks—possibly months—had passed since I received that Atari 400 for my 13th birthday. While I had not seen hide nor hair of this “magical” BASIC cartridge my brother was endlessly talking about, I had moved up the ranks in *Star Raiders* from “Garbage Scow Captain” to “Warrior.” It was a proud achievement of mine—and even my dad—but not to my brother. He saw games as nothing more than a distraction from the real purpose of a computer: Endlessly looking at lines of code to program something. Which was something I could not do—and didn’t even sound like fun—until I got that confounded BASIC cartridge.

And then one week my brother showed up at our Brighton Beach home with the magical BASIC cartridge. And boy was it an underwhelming experience.

“Here it is!” he said as he passed it onto me. The packaging had been crushed and was opened since my brother and his wife wanted to try it out on the loaned Atari 800 they had in their home. So it was less than a part of a gift, and more of an aftermarket addition to the Atari 400 system I had.

After taking it out of the crushed box and sticking it into the slot of the Atari 400, my brother showed me some litreral “basic” BASIC programming things such as how to crete a GOTO loop. He also showed me some sine/cosine function I barely understood past it drawing a few curvy lines on the screen.

“And now, you can program games!” he said with no awareness of how little I cared or even understood any of what he was showing me.

And you know, it retrospect this all sounds condescening and mean towards my brother. And maybe it is. At the end of the day he—and his wife at the time who truly initiated the purchase of this thing—did have good intentions with their actions. But the problem wasn’t what their intentions might have been as much as their endlessly stubborn attitude when it came to defining what should be done with gifts they gave to me or anyone else. If they gave me a computer it was to compute; not play games. Only “stupid” people do “stupid” things like enjoy playing games and such.

As I said at the outset, by the time I given this BASIC cartridge I had already become a “Warrior” in *Star Raiders*. And I was damned proud of that acheivement and I tried to show him some of the achievements I had earned. But no sooner than I booted up the game to show him what I could do that he then turned around and shut the computer down, swapped out the cartridge and stuck in the BASIC cartridge yet again to show me more programming tips and tricks.

Cornered and powerless, all I could do was nod politely, listen to his seemingly endless self-centered, unwanted computer programming lessons and then pretend to program myself to make him happy with his efforts. Monkey see, monkey do… But this 13 year old “monkey” did not understand or care.

Programming an Atari 400 was not fun, but at some point I fooled myself into thinking I could program a game. Not for my own benefit, but more for my own self-preservation. If I could program something—anything—in BASIC and show my brother my “progress” as each week went on, I believed I could get him off my back. “See! I can program! Now go away!” was my own dellsional “Stockholm Sydrome”-like way of dealing with this nonsense.



But it didn’t work. My programming at the time stunk and I didn’t enjoy it. Slowly I learned about the world of pirated software and slowly—but surely—me and my neighborhood friends would copy and trade games with each other. This was actually fun. It was social. For the price of some blank cassettes I could have a social circle focused on copying and playing games.

But whenever my brother visited and saw me playing games some outburst would occur. If I showed him the game I was playing, 9 times out of 10 he would declare it to be stupid. I had no idea how to respond so I let these outbursts pass and keep on playing.

Soon enough I was able to wrap myself up in these games that when my brother came over, the passive aggressive—or even outright aggressive—violence could be numbed by staring at these games and being immersed in this world.

As time passed, my brother begrudgingly accepted I only wanted to play video games and would never program any games. I felt like I won a victory against him until I realized that I was trapped in something I never wanted and had to endure years of verbal and psychological abuse because of this “gift.”

If I was only given a video game system at the time all could be peaceful and happy. But instead—like all of my brother’s “gifts” and interactions—I had to get wrapped up in his bullshit to find any enjoyment in what he gave me.

In retrospect I should have done with that computer what I did with virtually all of the “gifts” he and his wife gave me over the years: Just not use it, toss it in the closet and throw it out after a few years.

Another proud achievement was discovering the early computer magazines of the day and the free programs they published in their pages.

When I say these programs were “free” and “published in their pages” I am being quite literal: In the early days of computer publishing, small programs would literally be printed on the pages of the magazine and you would have to carefully type them in by hand to get them to work.
