## Atari 400 Bullshit (Part 3)
### Title says it all.

By Jack Szwergold

A few weeks later Ben showed up with the magical BASIC cartridge. The packaging had been crushed and was opened sine my brother and his wife wanted to try it out on the loaned Atari 800 they had in their home.

Ben showed me some basic BASIC programming and I learned such thrilling things such as how to do a GOTO loop. Ben also showed me some sine/cosine function I barely understood past it drawing a few curvy lines on the screen.

“And now, you can program games!” he said with no awareness of how little I cared.

By the time he gave me this cartridge I had become an expert at “Star Raiders.” I tried to show him some game level achievements I had made. But no sooner than I booted up the game he then powered the computer up to show me BASIC yet again.

I nodded politely, listened to his self-centered, unwanted computer programming lessons and then pretended to program myself.

It was not fun, but at some point I fooled myself into thinking I could program a game. Not for my own benefit, but for my own self-preservation. If I could do some basic BASIC and show my brother my “progress” as each week went on, I believed I could get him off my back.

But it didn’t work. My programming at the time stunk and I didn’t enjoy it. Slowly I learned about the world of pirated software and slowly—but surely—me and my neighborhood friends would copy and trade games with each other. This was actually fun. It was social. For the price of some blank cassettes I could have a social circle focused on copying and playing games.

But whenever my brother visited and saw me playing games some outburst would occur. If I showed him the game I was playing, 9 times out of 10 he would declare it to be stupid. I had no idea how to respond so I let these outbursts pass and keep on playing.

Soon enough I was able to wrap myself up in these games that when my brother came over, the passive aggressive—or even outright aggressive—violence could be numbed by staring at these games and being immersed in this world.

As time passed, my brother begrudgingly accepted I only wanted to play video games and would never program any games. I felt like I won a victory against him until I realized that I was trapped in something I never wanted and had to endure years of verbal and psychological abuse because of this “gift.”

If I was only given a video game system at the time all could be peaceful and happy. But instead—like all of my brother’s “gifts” and interactions—I had to get wrapped up in his bullshit to find any enjoyment in what he gave me.

In retrospect I should have done with that computer what I did with virtually all of the “gifts” he and his wife gave me over the years: Just not use it, toss it in the closet and throw it out after a few years.
