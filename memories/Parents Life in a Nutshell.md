You know, my parents met in the literal rubble of post-war Poland in 1945.

Dad was a soldier in Ander’s Army and survived the Gulag in Alma-Ata; contracted malaria there with my grandfather who succumbed to it.

Mom survived on her wits; her whole teenage life (13 to 21) was spent on the run.

They settled post-war in formerly German land that was annexed by Poland.

My mom had a property deed from her Uncle who was murdered by the Nazis.

She tried to make a claim to that property. They followed up by sending soldiers to kick down their door claiming back taxes on the land.

After that they headed to Israel as a way station between Poland and the U.S.

Why didn’t they stay in Israel? Who knows!

They passed away within months of each other 30+ years ago. 

But the idea they should “go back to Poland” is past laughable. They lived in annexed German lands in Poland.
