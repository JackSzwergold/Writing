## Latkes for Fluffy
### About How My Mom and Dad Would Overfeed me Potato Pancakes on the Weekend and How I Would Toss Them Out the Window for the Super’s Dog to Eat

By Jack Szwergold

While our family didn’t formally eat meals like a family, eating food and making food was a constant.

Seemingly each weekend during my childhood, my mom and dad would buy a huge bag of potatoes and a huge bag of onions and just make a huge pile of latkes; also known as potato pancakes.

I am not exaggerating when I say that past take out pizza, there was no other food to eat in the house on weekends other than latkes.

Sometimes they made them in anticipation of visitors coming by. Other times they would make it because there was a good deal on onions or potatoes at a local market. But in general, making latkes was a weekend tradition that I miss as an adult but grew a bit sick of as a kid.

I woke up in the morning, I would be offered latkes. I would come home from playing outside, I would be offered latkes. I would get ready to go to sleep at night, I would be offered latkes.

I was just tired of them.

One day, instead of saying “No!” to my parents and causing unuintended drama, I decided to say “Yes!” to them when latkes were offered.

I would sit down at my desk, take a bite of one or two of them and then toss the rest out to Fluffy, the super’s dog in the airway below.

It even got to the point where Fluffy could almost predict she would be fed latkes at a certain hour on certain days on the weekened and would constantly look up at my window in anticipation.

This scheme worked well for a few weekends until one day Johnny—the super—came up to talk to my dad.

It turns out Fluffy was getting sick and nobody could figure out why. Turns out that fried potato pancakes might taste good, but aren’t good for dogs.

And after quietly talking to my dad a while, my dad walked over to my room, opened up the door and said, “Jack you can’t throw the latkes out the window anymore.” Johnny chimed in an basically said the same adding, “Fluffy gets sick from them! And your mom and dad work all day making them so you can eat them.”

I agreed to never toss latkes out the window to Fluffy ever again and watched as Johnny left our apartment with a small pile of latkes wrapped in aluminum foil in his hand.
