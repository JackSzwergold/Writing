### About Not Seeing *Star Wars* for the Third Time

By Jack Szwergold

The third time I was apparently going to see *Star Wars* was with my sister her husband. It was the summer of 1977 and they came by my parents place in Brighton Beach and her husband just impulsively said, “You want to go see *Star Wars*?” I said immediately, “Yeah, but I saw it already in camp and with my brother.” This time I made sure they at least knew I saw the film so I didn’t end up in the same mess as the last time with my brother. He said, “So what? We’ll go see it again.” Which seemed friendly and honest enough of a response, so why not? So we headed to the subway at Ocean Parkway, hopped on a train and about an hour later we got off at Bryant Park on 42nd Street near Times Square.

Bryant Park wasn’t Times Square, but it was close enough. We walked up 42nd Street past King Karol Records, past the storefront peep shows, made a right onto Broadway, walked past the Nathan’s and headed towards 44th Street.

*Star Wars* was the only thing playing at the Loews Astor Plaza and the theater was the only one in the city playing *Star Wars*. By this time in the summer, buzz about the film being something everone should see reached a new hight point and the line wrapped around the block. My sister’s husband immediately said, “I don’t want to wait in line.” I suggested we go back to Nathan’s to have some hot dogs. They also had some video games there so I was trying to make the best of a bad situation. He immediately shot down that idea and looked around. Some other theater was showing *Smokey and the Bandit* and he said we we’re gong to see that.

I had no desire to see it since I was a kid I was promised *Star Wars* but I really had no choice. I knew how to take the subway back home—I was pretty street smart for a young kid—but there’s no way they would let me do that. So we went to see *Smokey and the Bandit*.

The theater wasn’t completely empty but it was pretty dead. We all headed to an aisle in the center that was completely empty and sat down. My sister sat down to my right, her husband to her right and me to their mutual left. Her husband bought a huge box of Sno-Caps he occasional shared when he wasn’t pouring them down his mouth but past that we didn’t get any other refreshments.

*Smokey and the Bandit* was boring and stupid to me as a kid. Still pretty boring and stupid to me as an adult. Just scene upon stupid scene of car chases with the faces of Sally Field and Burt Reynolds filling up the screen every so often. And every now and then Jackie Gleason’s face would pop up all red and angry because of what Burt Reynolds just did to upset him. Sporadically my sister’s husband’s arm would aggressibly poke me to ask if I liked the film. I didn’t in any way but I nodded “yes” every so often; did I have any choice but to like it at this point? I was basically a kid and a third wheel on their improvised date. What would happen if I said “No?”

At one point—about 30 or so minutes—into the film I either faked falling asleep or actually slept or faked falling asleep and then fell asleep. I knew the movie ended when I was shaken awake and we headed home.

We took the subway home, went upstairs to the apartment and I immediately went into my room and to read some comics and play with some toys. My sister and her husband hung out in the living room with my parents and left me alone. My dad knocked on the door and asked if I wanted anything to eat. I said yes and a short while later some potato latkes or cheese blintzes were delivered.

I stopped what I was doing and sat down at my desk eating. The desk faced the elevated subway station at Ocean Parkway. I sat and stared at the trains and clouds out the window as I ate. It was a much nicer view than the TV set.

My sister and her husband came in my room and asked, “Did you have fun?” I said “Yes!” even though I hated it. What else is a kid supposed to say at the very moment adults are asking a loaded question? Besides they’d be gone in a few minutes, so who cares.

With that they said their goodbyes to my parents and left. I finished eating and went back to playing on the green, ratty carpet that lined my room as the bright summer sun shone in. A few minutes later would fall asleep for a quick nap; comfortably surrounded by my toys and comics.
