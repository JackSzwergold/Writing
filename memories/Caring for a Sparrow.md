## Caring for a Sparrow
### About the Time My Parents Found a Sparrow in Front of Our Building

By Jack Szwergold

Not too sure when this happened. Pretty sure it was in the early 1980s for me; right the near the end of junior high school or beginning of high school.

I was sitting around my room, putzing around and not doing much of anything. Both of my parents were outside doing something. Maybe walking around, maybe shopping, maybe gossiping with the other older Yiddish folks in front of the building or something like that… The usual stuff like that. I had no idea to be honest with you because I was just happy to have the whole apartment to myself. And was really happy to be able to enjoy the freedom but just putzing around in my room.

Then suddenly my dad unlocked the door to our apartment and came into my room and said, “We found a bird!” A bird? I didn’t understand what he meant? Being a poor, Yiddish family I somehow assumed that he might have found some really good—and possibly free—chickens somewhere in Brighton Beach. But as he held the door open and my mom came into the apartment it was pretty clear that my mom and dad found—and were bringing into the apartment—an actual bird: It seemed to be a small sparrow she held as she ran towards the kitchen.

My dad closed the door and I followed my mom to the kitchen. She grabbed a small melamine plate, and placed the small sparrow—which was wrapped in some tissues—onto the plate and shouted to my dad saying something in Yiddish. He ran over to her, and gently put his hand over her hand—which was hovering over the bird—and she moved her hand away so as to relieve herself of her “Make sure the bird doesn’t fly away!” duties so she could get out of her coat.

I looked at the sparrow on the plate. The tissues fell away and all that was left was this small, gawky little sparrow with an oddball baby-bird look on its beak. It seemed stunned but didn’t seem freaked out or looking to fly away very soon. My dad said, “We were sitting in front of the building and the bird fell out of a tree.” He continued, “We picked it up so nobody would step on it.”

Made sense. But this was weird. What would we do with this thing? As I was thinking about that, my mom came back into the kitchen and started talking to my dad in Yiddish. Instantly they both swapped between protecting the sparrow, getting water for the sparrow and looking around the kitchen for food to feed the sparrow. After a while, they settled on turning over a small jar lid and filling it with water and then placing some ripped up bread next to the sparrow. The sparrow seemed to accept the water but was a bit finicky about the bread.

“So do you need me to help?” I asked my dad and he said, “No… No… We’re fine.” And with that I headed back to my room to putz around and—eventually—take a nap.

When I woke up from my nap, I walked over to the living room. My mom and dad were watching TV and I asked them about the sparrow. “Okay, let me show you!” My dad said as he got out of his chair and walked to the kitchen. I followed and it was dark since it was already dusk. So he turned on the light and the plate with the sparrow was no longer on the kitchen table. “Where is it?” I asked and with that he walked to the kitchen window, pulled back the small curtain and showed me: He placed the small sparrow and the plate with water and food out on the small window ledge our kitchen had.

The window was closed except for one of those metal mesh screens but I could look out and see the bird sitting there somewhat as befuddled as before. I looked at it for a while as a subway train pulled out of the nearby, elevated subway station and screeched into the distance as it made it’s way to Coney Island. As the sound of the train faded I could hear the sound of some birds chirping from the nearby roof.

I had no idea if they were sparrows or not, but I could see the little straggler my parents found was tilting it’s head as if to listen to the chirps and screeches. At one point, the sparrow chirped along which made me realize that had never chirped at all before while in our apartment or on that ledge. As it chirped more and more, other chirps became louder until a few small sparrows landed on the ledge and looked around. It seems like they all knew each other and might at least know who this fledgling straggler we rescued was.

After a while, the sparrow we rescued started to move around a bit and flap it’s wings. It clearly was not an expert at doing bird things like that just yet, but with a few hops—and a few flaps—that tiny straggler managed to fly off of our roof and fly to the roof of the drugstore that abutted our building and was—literally—a short hop from our kitchen window. The other sparrows followed it and chirped some more on the nearby roof. I couldn’t see what was happening as the sparrow cacophony carried on, but after a while I saw a small group of sparrows fly away from the drugstore roof and off to Ocean Parkway.

My dad was busy making some food on the stove while this whole thing transpired, so I turned around to tell him. He came to the window, looked at the ledge with the now empty plate, looked towards the nearby roof and basically shrugged and said, “Okay… What else?” as he walked to the living room to talk to my mom in Yiddish.

She came into the kitchen and looked out the window with my dad and shrugged and walked away.

There was nothing negative about these shrugs and nothing dismissive. It was all very pragmatic; my parents spotted a small sparrow in trouble, helped it get it’s act back in gear and now it flew away with the other sparrows it presumably knew.

And with that, my dad finished making whatever food he was making, put it on a plate and headed back to the living room to watch some more TV. I grabbed something myself and headed back to my room and called it a night.
