## Caring for a Sparrow
### About the Time My Parents Found a Sparrow in Front of Our Building

By Jack Szwergold

Not too sure when this happened. Pretty sure it was in the early 1980s for me; right the near the end of junior high school or beginning of high school.

I was sitting around my room, putzing around and not doing much of anything. Both of my parents were outside doing something. Maybe walking around, maybe shopping, maybe gossiping with the other older Yiddish folks in front of the building or something like that… The usual stuff like that. I had no idea to be honest with you because I was just happy to have the whole apartment to myself. And was really happy to be able to enjoy the freedom but just putzing around in my room.

Then suddenly my dad unlocked the door to our apartment and came into my room and said, “We found a bird!” A bird? I didn’t understand what he meant? Being a poor, Yiddish family I somehow assumed that he might have found some really good—and possibly free—chickens somewhere in Brighton Beach. But as he held the door open and my mom came into the apartment it was pretty clear that my mom and dad found—and were bringing into the apartment—an actual bird: It seemed to be a small sparrow she held as she ran towards the kitchen.

My dad closed the door and I followed my mom to the kitchen. She grabbed a small melamine plate, and placed the small sparrow—which was wrapped in some tissues—onto the plate and shouted to my dad saying sometihng in Yiddish. He ran over to her, and gently put his hand over her hand—which was hovering over the bird—and she moved her hand away so as to relieve herself of her “Make sure the bird doesn’t fly away!” duties so she could get out of her coat.

I looked at the sparrow on the plate. The tissues fell away and all that was left was this small, gawky little sparrow with an oddball baby-bird look on its beack. It seemed stunned but didn’t seem freaked out or looking to fly away very soon. My dad said, “We were sitting in front of the building and the bird fell out of a tree.” He continued, “We picked it up so nobody would step on it.”

Made sense. But this was weird. What would we do with this bird? As I was thinking about that, my mom came back into the kicthen and started talking to my dad in Yiddish. Instantly they both swapped between protecting the bird, getting water for the bird and looking around the kitchen for food to feed the bird. After a while, they settled on turning over a small jar lid and filling it with water and then placing some ripped up bread next to the bird.
