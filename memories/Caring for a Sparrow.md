## Caring for a Sparrow
### About the Time My Parents Found a Sparrow in Front of Our Building

By Jack Szwergold

Not too sure when this happened. Pretty sure it was in the early 1980s for me; right the near the end of junior high school or beginning of high school.

I was sitting around my room, putzing around and not doing much of anything. Both of my parents were outside doing something. Maybe walking around, maybe shopping, maybe gossiping with the other older Yiddish folks in front of the building or something like that… The usual stuff like that. I had no idea to be honest with you because I was just happy to have the whole apartment to myself. And was really happy to be able to enjoy the freedom but just putzing around in my room.

Then suddenly my dad unlocked the door to our apartment and came into my room and said, “We found a bird!” A bird? I didn’t understand what he meant? Being a poor, Yiddish family I somehow assumed that he might have found some really good—and possibly free—chickens somewhere in Brighton Beach. But as he held the door open and my mom came into the apartment it was pretty clear that my mom and dad found—and were brining into the apartment—an actual bird: It seemed to be a small sparrow.
