### Memories of My Parents Going to Work and Me Going to School and the Reverse at the End of the Day

By Jack Szwergold

My parents both worked factopry jobs at different times in the family and never really talked much about it.

My earliest memory was being a kid in the 1970s and getting up early around the same time as my dad to eat breakfast and get ready to go to elementary school. I’d also watch TV which mostly consisted of “The Little Rascals” and whatever random cartoon program channels 5, 9 and 11 had on at the time.

For whatever reason my parents really didn’t turn on any lights past the basics early in the morning. So it was always a tad dark in the apartment with only the blue glow of the black and white TV in the living room and maybe a light on in the kitchen and basics and the blobs of sunlight that would slowly leak through the windows at dawn.

I remember sitting on my mom’s lap and eating cereal—and maybe a banana—as we both watched TV. At some point my dad would come into the living room, speak to my mom—in English, Polish, Yiddish or some mix of them—and then I would get a kiss on the cheek goodbye from him.

I sat on the couch as my mom went over to bid farewell at the front door, lock it and head back into the living room.

Then it was my turn to finish up eating, wash up, get dressed and head off to school.

Walking in the streets early in the morning was fun. It was quiet yet busy with newspapers and groceries being delivered while kids like me headed off to school, and adults headed off to wherever.
