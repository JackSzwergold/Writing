### Memories of My Parents Going to Work and Me Going to School and the Reverse at the End of the Day

By Jack Szwergold

My parents both worked factory jobs at different times of their lives in the family and never really talked much about it. Kinda typical for any working class family I guess; forget the past and keep on moving forward to some kind of better future.

That said, my earliest memory of my parent’s working life was as a kid in the 1970s and getting up early around the same time as my dad to eat breakfast and get ready to go to elementary school. In my case, I’d also watch TV which consisted mostly of an endless stream of “The Little Rascals” reruns and whatever random cartoon cavalcade program channels 5, 9 and 11 might have had on at the time.

For whatever reason my parents really didn’t turn on any lights past the basics early in the morning. So it was always a tad dark in the apartment. Only the blue glow of the black and white TV in the living room mixed with the light of one lone table lamp in the living room and kitchen would mix with small blobs of sunlight that would leak through the edges of the windowshade at dawn.

I remember sitting on my mom’s lap and eating cereal—and maybe a banana—as we both watched TV. At some point my dad would come into the living room, speak to my mom—in English, Polish, Yiddish or some mix of them—and then I would get a kiss on the cheek goodbye from him.

I sat on the couch as my mom went over to bid farewell at the front door, lock it and head back into the living room.

Then it was my turn to finish up eating, wash up, get dressed and head off to school.

Walking in the streets early in the morning was fun. It was quiet yet busy with newspapers and groceries being delivered while kids like me headed off to school, and adults headed off to wherever.

About a decade later I was in high school which was about 4 blocks away from home. So outside of playing video games or grabbing a slice of pizza with friends, I was usually home by 4:00pm tops.

A lot of times when I came home, my dad would be staring at the subway station out the window of my room.

“How was your day?” he would usually as me, and I would usually respond, “Fine…” as I dropped my book bag down on my desk and settled in.

“Do you want anything to eat?” he’d ask and I would usually say, “Yes…” and then he would head out of my room, down the hallway and into the kitchen.

Depending on my mood, I would either play video games, read magazines, listen to music, or all of the above. And sometimes I would do homework, but I would delay that as much as possible.

Since you could easily hear subway trains from out apartment, my dad would pop in and out of my room anytime he heard one screech into the station.

He was waiting for my mom to get home. And she always made sure to wave at us when she got off the train and headed home. Sometimes we could see her on the subway platform. Other times, from the staircase area just below. But in general, he popped in an out mainly to wave at her and she to wave at him.

Soon enough he spotted her and food was ready for me. We knew that in about 10 to 15 minutes she would be back home… Unless she had the urge to head over to Met Foods or the jeweler down the block or felt like gossiping with the Yentas in front of the building… But for the most part, the second we saw her at the subway station we knew she would be home soon.

When she came home, she’d greet us all, drop all of her stuff off in her bedroom and then eat something as well. We never really ate formally as a family, but we generally ate at the same time… And sometimes in the same general vicinity if we were all watching something on TV.

She’d then clean up, head to bed or maybe even head outside to gossip some more with the Yentas.

But by the time 10:00pm came around, she and my dad would basically be in bed and I might still be up with the door to my room locked up until I too felt tired enough to conk out for the night as well.
