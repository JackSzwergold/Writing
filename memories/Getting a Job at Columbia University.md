## Getting a Job at Columbia University
### About the Time My Brother “Helped” Me Get My First Job as a Teenager at Columbia University

By Jack Szwergold

**QUICK NOTES**: Write about my first “job” working for my brother at Columbia University as a 13 year old kid. Basically my brother knew I wanted a job to earn money at the time and told me he knew of a job. Naively I believed he knew of a real job at Columbia University. The reality was he made me his “lab assistant” or some bullshit like that and paid me out of his own pocket. I even explicitly asked him if there was a “job” and he said “Yes, this is your job!” smiling as if I would be happy about this. I hated it. It wasn’t a job. It was another example of my brother attempting to control my life and rip me away from our father.

I was about 14 years old and wanted a summer job. Every other friend of mine had a summer job doing something somewhere, and I wanted one too. I wanted the indepence, the freedome but—most of all—I wanted the money a job would give me.

So around the time of my 14th birtday I started to look for jobs but really had no idea where to start. I told my parents I wanted a job and my mom said she would ask someone at her factory if I could get a job. I was kind of excited, but not sure what that meant. My mom got up early each day, worked long hours and usually came home and collapsed in bed. Maybe there was some summer job for a teenager at the factory I could handle? Who knows.

Anway, during one of my brother’s visits to the family home, he got wind of me wanting a job while sitting at the kitchen table, Before he could say anything our mom would say, “Yes! I will get a Jack a job in the factory. A good job!” to which my brother started shouting and screaming about.

I have no idea what the shouting and screaming was about—why should my brother care about me wanting a job—but I finished my food, excused myself and headed back to my room.

The fighting persisted for some time until it stoped. I knew something was up since—while my mom and dad wreen’t fighting—they were worriedly talking to each other. I could hear some hushed tones as the TV went on in the living room and then I heard a knock on my door.

It was my dad who peeked into my room and said, “I don’t know… Working at mom’s place might not be a good idea… Ben knows…” and then he went away.

Soon after Ben came into my room and sat down on the floor in front of me and calmly said, “If you want a job I have a very good job for you at Columbia University.”

“Really?” I said, “Doing what?” I asked.

“Don’t worry, it’s very good… Just come to me on Monday and I will show you…”

With that he left me room and I waited for Monday.

I took the train up to Columbia University. Did it by myself. D to 59th Street to the A to 168h Street.

Got off of the train and walked to the building my brother’s lab was in.

He was outside waiting for me and waved. I imagined he would show me someone—or bring me someplace—where I could get a real job. I imaged for a place like Columbia University I would need working papers—since I was only 14 at the time—but my brother said not too worry.

We went into the building and headed up the the elevator. Where I did not know?

“What kind of job is this again?” I asked and he said, “You will see… Don’t worry…”

And soon enough we got off at some non-descript floor, walked into a non-descript room and my brother said, “Here is where you will work!” I was confused… I saw nobody else… Just me and my brother in this miscellaneous lab.

“Here?” I asked. “Who am I working for?” I asked again.

“Me! You can be my assitant!” he said.

And with that I felt my mind twist inside of itself. This is not what I wanted. I wanted a real job where I would be paid. I asked my brother who would pay me—assuming there was some kind of arrangement with the university and this was normal—and he responded, “I will! Do not worry!“

And with that I had no idea what to do. If I left at that momement, my brother would cut me off and corner me. In his mind it was perfectly normal that he would pay me out of his own pocket for a “job” like this so there was no simple escape. So I decided to stay and make the best of it.

I ran some small errands for him around his lab, but for the most part my supposed “job” was to simply sit there and listen to my brother endlessly bather on about his work.

You see, when I was 14 I was in some required science classes in Junior High School. I didn’t particularly like them or hate them; they were simply required classes. But in his mind the fact I was—for example—studying biochemistry meant I actually had a passion for the subject. Thus somehow I would care to listen to him blather on and on about whatever grad student class bullshit he was doing as if I cared.

In between that bullshit I did things like use pipettes to fill things or use the autoclave to disinfect things. But there was no independence in these tasks. No matter what I did or how I did it, my brother was hovering nearby, micromanaging me.

It was horrible. But at least he paid. How much, I don’t remember, but I remember at the end of each day he would pull some money out of his pocket and gave it to me. It felt less like a job and more like he was paying me to be his friend.

I went along with this for a few weeks. The through is he was able to buy my friendship. I did want the money. But then—at some point—our father got wind of what Ben was doing and was angry. He said I should not take Ben’s money… He would just give me whatever money I needed.

Superficially this seemed great financially, but it was horrible otherwise: My dysfunctional brother wants to literally buy my friendship and my father is threatened by my brother’s behavior and I did not know what to do.

I talked to a friend of mine who worked at a local Knish store and asked if he could hook me up with a job. “But don’t you already have one?” he said. “It’s not a real job. It stinks,” I replied. And he said he would ask and see but it wasn’t like it would happen right away. I understood and told him I was cool with that and left it at that.

The week before my friend was going to hook me up with a job at the Knish shop, I was at Columbia University “working” for my brother again.

Something odd was happening on something I was working on for him and I asked for help. “You should just use the stuff in that bottle over there.” he shouted. “Which one?” I replied. “I just don’t understand what is happening.” “You’ve done this before,“ he retorted condescendingly, “You know what you sholuld be doing.” But I didn’t know what I should do nor did ever do this before; he was simply dellusional.

So in an effort to fix what was screwed up I grabbed the nearest bottle and carefully put the stuff into the test tubes. Nothing changed. “I need your help,” I asked. “I don’t think I did the right thing.” I said trying to hold back my frustration in trying to communicte with him.

With that he angrilly came over, saw what I did and startd to scream at me about how I was “stupid” and ruined this project. I started to stammer and almost cry… I really didn’t know what I was supposed to do or why the thing wasn’t working. I asked for help, right? Anyway, in a huff he took the test tubes and walked out of the lab.

I felt stunned, shocked and assaulted. I looked at the wall at a nearby calendar and tried to calculate how much more of this I had to deal with. At best one week if I could get the job at the Knish place. But that one week seemed like an eternity.

I turned to a nearby sink and notcied
