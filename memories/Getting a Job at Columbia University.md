## Getting a Job at Columbia University
### About the Time My Brother “Helped” Me Get My First Job as a Teenager at Columbia University

Anway, during one of my brother’s visits to the family home, he got wind of me wanting a job while sitting at the kitchen table, Before he could say anything our mom would say, “Yes! I will get a Jack a job in the factory. A good job!” to which my brother started shouting and screaming about.
