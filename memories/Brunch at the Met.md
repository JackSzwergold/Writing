# Brunch at the Met

**Quick Notes**: Danny Alfred and I going to the Met. Involve the background of hanging out with him and watching him dissociate. End with his mom saying it’s good that I hung out with him and him joining some odd overseas religious group.

Danny was a high school friend of a friend from Midwood. He lived on East 15th Street near Avenue J. He lived in Midwood and went to Midwood High School. I lived in Brighton Beach and went to Abraham Lincoln High School. We got along because we were weirdos and had a mutual friend; a connector if you will.

Anyway, Danny was a friend and one day we headed up to the Met Museum. I think we somehow both had school projects that involved the museum. I barely recall what mine was, but I know we wandered and took notes.

“Pretty cool, huh?” he said as we passed by some sculptures. “Yeah, I guess,” I said. To be honest, I tolerated the trip to the museum more than I enjoted it. The emotional scarring of being dragged to the Met as a kid less than 10 years prior was still burned in my head. “All this stuff is boring,” was my defense mechanism at the time.

“Boring?” Danny said. “What is boring about this?” He said effortlessly waving his hand around.

“I dunno,” I said as I skulked around.

After a short while we left. As I walked out the doors and stepped down onto the stairs of the museum, I felt the afteroon sun, air and sky and — most of all — I felt free.

“Let’s get out of here,” I said.

“Why? Let’s hang out,” he responded.

As I looked around at the throngs of tourists, hot dog carts and general tourist hell I said, “Why? Let’s just go to the Village if you want to hang out.”

“Fine,” he responded. And with that we both walked down towards the Lexington Avenue subway.

As we headed down whatever street in the 80s on the Upper East Side we were on, we passed some small bakery. The window was filled with tarts of some kind. They all seemed pretty expensive for a high school kid with little to no disposable income.

“I want them!” Danny said. “Whose going to pay for them?” I asked. “Let me see how much they cost,” he said as he headed inside. I stood outside and waited.

After a while he came out and said, “They’re like $4 to $5 a piece.” He said as we conitnued walking. “That’s more than a slice of pizza and a soda,” I said. I mean it was the 1980s and the cost to ride a subway was $1 and a soda was around ¢45 to ¢50 at the time.

“Come on! Let’s do it one day!” he said. “Do what?” I asked. “Get some tarts and just sit on the steps in front of the Met Museum. “And then what?” I asked. “Let’s just be cool and do that,” he said.

With that we got on the subway.

“So we would just sit there? There’s nobody our age or anytihng there. You just want to sit on the steps and be cool?” I said. “Yes! Exactly!” he said.

I just simply shrugged and say back in my seat and let that pass.

We decided to skip heading over to the Village and headed back home on the D train. Danny got off at Avenue J and I stayed on to head back to Ocean Parkway.

A few weeks pass and I get a call from Danny on a Saturday afternon.

“What’s up?” I ask. “Let’s do it!” he says. “Do what?” I ask. “Let’s go hang out at the Met!”

I rolled my eyes, set a time and got the subway and met up with Danny at the Avenue J station.

“This all seems like bullshit,” I said to which Danny replied, “Oh come on, how much money did you bring along?” he asked. I said I had about $12 or $13. “That’s all?” he said and I responded, “How many tarts are we going to eat exactly?” He nodded and we rode the subway, transferred at Atlantic Avenue and headed to the Upper East Side.

We got off the train and walked over to the small bakery and each bought a tart. I remmeber mine being something like cherry and lemon.
