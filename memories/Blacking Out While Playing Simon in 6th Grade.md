# Blacking Out While Playing Simon in 6th Grade

It was 6th grade and as after my 5th grade science fair victory and somehow I was living this “future scientist” lie. My science teacher (Mr. Schwartz) would endlessly compliment me on my science fair project in 5th grade. It all felt weird and felt like a lie.

To be honest, the feeling was similar to the one I had getting a commendation card in 3rd grade for my book report on Roberto Clemente where I just hand copied the flap copy from the book and somehow won. But this was different. Winning a science fair somehow implied you would be a scientist or something like that. I didn’t want that and yet it was foisted upon my by a miserable overbearing brother who had deeply unresolved parental issues.

So it’s 6th grade and when it came time for me to do a science project, I decided to make a model of the human eye using a pink rubber ball cut in half and other improvised things. It was very “outsider art” in it’s own way. I liked it! So did my dad, But my science teacher said he expected more.

When I showed my brother the project he said, “Why did you make this garbage? You should make a better thing!” But I didn’t care about winning or losing a science fair; I wanted to make something of my own and not live a lie.

Near the end of the school year, my brother was attempting to not meddle in my elementary school life anymore. But he insisted that I bring the Simon game him and his wife liked to play. I kinda hated it and thought it was stupid. But he basically bullied me into taking it to school to show off to the science class in some weird way of asserting my tech knowledge.

I brought it to science class and basically said, “My brother wanted you to see this,” and before you know it the class was playing Simon. Like I said I hated it, but I felt no power to tell my brother, “No!” So here I was, playing this game I didn’t like for reasons I didn’t like with fellow classmates who thought I was “showing off” since an electronic game like Simon was a luxury for anyone to own in a poor, working class neighborhood like that in the 1970s.

When it came to be my turn to do what you gotta do to play Simon, I couldn’t see the flashing lights. I complained it was too bright, so the teacher closed the shades a bit. I was upset; I still couldn’t see the lights. I was feeling anxious and passed my turn. People looked at me weird. Soon the class ended and when I went to pick up the Simon to take it home, I felt anxiousness in my hands and eyes. Pretty confident my eyes blanked out then and before when I tried to play the game. My mind knew that I didn’t like any of this, but unable to stop myself my senses attempted to protect me by blacking out when I needed to not be there.

I returned the Simon to my brother and he declared, “So did your friends like it?” I responded yes and went back to my room to crawl into my bed and bury my head in the corner and turn off the world for a while.
