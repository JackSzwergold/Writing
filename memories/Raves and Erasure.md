## Raves and Erasure

By Jack Szwergold

Pete was an asshole. I knew he was an asshole before I even knew who he was or even heard of him. Friends of mine who knew him simply referred to him as, “That asshole.” And he was a friend of Todd the asshole who was also known as an asshole to all who knew him.

Pete and Todd were a couple of assholes.

Pete was a jerk in the college town he lived in and then—like all assholes and jerks—he moved off to New York City to work as some toadie in the world of banking and financing. He himself wasn’t a wheeler and dealer, but he fancied himself a journalist; a shaper of words.

He worked for some WASPy, slimy guy named Hank or Howard or something. The guy looked like Howdy Doody and acted like a twitchy kid who drank too much coffee or snorted took much cocaine. The guy got busted for insider trading or something, was busted and convicted but it was a slap on the wrist at best. He ended up back on the street doing what he does: Writing finance articles and nonsense but this time for a start-up.
 
Anyway, that paints the picture of who Pete was to an extent. Another aspect of his persona was he liked going to raves in the 1990s with a friend of all they nicknamed “Big Dumb Dave.”

Dave wasn’t really dumb at all… In fact he was a nice guy. And the most I knew about him at one point was simply that he liked the electro-pop band *Erasure*. I knew this before I even met Dave because Todd (the asshole) always thought that it was funny that Dave liked *Erasure* because Todd tagged them as a gay band.

“Does he know *Erasure*’s a gay band! Maybe he’s gay? Big dumb Dave is gay! He’s gay!!!” Todd shouted once at a bar giggling all the while. Never mind that Todd was a closet case who liked to paint his nails black and randomly attempt—and sometimes succeed—at sexual assault every now and then; men and women, friends and strangers.

But I digress… Pete and Dave liked to go to raves. Dave—the guy who liked *Erasure*—liked to go to raves and enjoy himself in the music and the scene. Pete tagged along, didn’t really like the music, and wasn’t really into the scene but did like one thing at raves: Grabbing random women dancing around in various states of inebriation and just outright molesting them. We all knew that he did that because Todd—who was obsessed with how people react at “The Bacchanal”—often gossiped about Pete’s conquests as a positive thing. But saying these things were conquests were a bit of a stretch; they were all non-consensual encounters that amounted to assault. And yes, Todd non-ironically referred to parties as “The Bacchanal.”

So that’s Pete in a nutshell: Pete liked to go to raves and assault women, Todd considered him a “hero” and a normal guy, and they both routinely harassed Dave for liking *Erasure* because that was “gay.” Tada!

Anyway, back in the midwest Pete was a bully. And in New York City Pete was still a bully. The stories of his conquests at raves were more than enough to confirm that fact.

But I had never met him before, until I came back to New York City.

I had my first real direct contact with him as we all gathered for a mutual friend’s birthday at a local bar in Park Slope. Things were low key and fun… Then Todd showed up with Pete not far behind and that changed everything.

While we all sat around enjoying the night; just drinking and shooting the shit. But Todd and Pete really just talked among themselves and side-eyed us all as we sat there together but separately.

After a while, Pete stood up, and walked over to me, dead staring me all the way like some predator.

“Look, this is fun but we have a party in the Lower East Side. You wanna come?” Pete asked in a demanding tone as Todd stood over his shoulder looking to me.

“Yeah… Sure, I guess?” I said as I looked over at the guy whose birthday was celebrating who mutually shrugged and nodded his head as well.

With that we headed outside of the bar on 5th Avenue in Park Slope, hailed two cabs and headed into Manhattan.

“Don’t worry Jack,” Pete said as we drove away in the cab, “I got it.” Which was an odd thing for him to say; why would paying for a cab require this kind of odd casual financial subordination?

So we arrived somewhere in the Lower East Side in that odd area near the East River known by real estate wonks as “Two Bridges.” The party was in a building that—to me—looked like public housing but was actually a co-op building. All of the similar buildings around there were co-ops of some sort; orange bricks, oddly manicured front lawns and general 1960s urban renewal genteelness.

We headed up in the elevator that reminded me of similar elevators in similar buildings in Brooklyn with one big difference: These elevators actually work. And as we get off on whatever floor this party was I notice that everything is clean and well maintained; a stark contrast to other similar buildings I knew of in Brooklyn.

A few short steps we were at the door where this “party” was happening and walked in.

The apartment was dark, theer were people and music and such, but the party seemed more to be like a small group of friends disconnecting from reality and being anti-social in a social way.

I saw a guy going around in a twitchy way telling people to not touch this, that and the other
