## Raves and Erasure

By Jack Szwergold

Pete was an asshole. I knew he was an asshole before I even knew who he was or even heard of him. Friends of mine who knew him simply referred to him as, “That asshole.” And he was a friend of Todd the asshole who was also known as an asshole to all who knew him.

Pete and Todd were a couple of assholes.

Pete was a jerk in the college town he lived in and then—like all assholes and jerks—he moved off to New York City to work as some toadie in the world of banking and financing. He himself wasn’t a wheeler and dealer, but he fancied himself a journalist; a shaper of words.

He worked for some WASPy, slimy guy named Hank or Howard or something. The guy looked like Howdy Doody and acted like a twitchy kid who drank too much coffee or snorted took much cocaine. The guy got busted for insider trading or something, was busted and convicted but it was a slap on the wrist at best. He ended up back on the street doing what he does: Writing finance articles and nonsense but this time for a start-up.
 
Anyway, that paints the picture of who Pete was to an extent. Another aspect of his persona was he liked going to raves in the 1990s with a friend of all they nicknamed “Big Dumb Dave.”

Dave wasn’t really dumb at all… In fact he was a nice guy. And the most I knew about him at one point was simply that he liked the electro-pop band *Erasure*. I knew this before I even met Dave because Todd (the asshole) always thought that it was funny that Dave liked *Erasure* becuase Todd tagged them as a gay band.

“Does he know *Erasure*’s a gay band! Maybe he’s gay? Big dumb Dave is gay! He’s gay!!!” Todd shouted once at a bar giggling all the while. Never mind that Todd was a closet case who liked to paint his nails black and randomly attempt—and sometimes succeed—at sexual assault every now and then; men and women, friends and strangers.

But I digress… Pete and Dave liked to go to raves. Dave—the guy who liked *Erasure*—liked to go to raves and enjoy himself in the music and the scene. Pete tagged along, didn’t really like the music, and wasn’t really into the scene but did like one thing at raves: Grabbing random women dancing around in various states of inebriation and just outright molesting them.

Anyway, back in the midwest Pete was a bully. And in New York City Pete was still a bully.

I had my first real direct contact with him as we all gathered for a mutual friend’s birthday at a local bar in Park Slope. Things were low key and fun… Then Todd showed up with Pete not far behind.

While we all sat around enjoying the night and just drinking and shooting the shit. But Todd and Pete really just talked among themselves and side-eyed us all as we sat there together but separately.

After a while, Pete stood up, dead staring me all the way like some predator.

 I ran into him at some party in the Lower East Side. He’s sitting in the kitchen and smoking a pot pipe as if it was a crack piper knowing how angry his energy was, maybe it was pot? Or meth? Anyway he mocked me for getting fired from the Onion. Sitting in the corner and saying, “Is this the guy who got fired? Good luck to you! Nice to know you!” Anyway, that’s a tangent.

Pete was a dick and is a dick. And he liked to go to raves with big dumb Dave.

For someone who hated the music, and even called Dave “gay” for liking it, he did like one thing: Molesting women at raves.  Grabbing them literally by the pussy and doing whatever he could. They would mock Dave for not getting any at raves, but at least Dave didn’t attack women.

But they still said he was gay and mocked him for liking Erasure.
