The first time I saw _Star Wars_ was in the NYC Department of Parks and Recreation day camp that was run out of the P.S. 100 playground in nearby Trump Village. The counsellors there were just neighborhood high school kids and part of our “summer camp experience” — along with playing in the same exact playgrounds we already had free access to — was being taken on buses to see movies as a group.

Since it was the 1970s they took us to any science fiction — or even light horror — film was out in theaters at the time. I saw _Godzilla versus Megalon_ (the one with Jet Jaguar) at the Trump Village Theater, _Squirm_ (the movie about killer worms) at the Benson Theater in Bensonhurst, _King Kong_ (the version at the World Trade Center) at the Alpine in Bay Ridge, _Bug_ (the one about killer cockroaches) at the Trump Village Theater and at some point I also saw _Futureworld_ in the theaters at King’s Plaza thanks to that dysfuctional day camp. All of those films sucked for different reasons; the list of literal crap we saw was endless. But seeing _Star Wars_ was different experience from the get go.

First, we were going to Manhattan to see the film which was out of the norm to say the least. All of the other films we saw were at dumpy Brooklyn theaters which were on their way to be shuttered or turned into a multiplex. To see _Star Wars_ we had to go to the only theater in the city that was showing it at the time: The Loews Astor Plaza in Times Square.

We all got into the yellow school buses, headed to Manhattan and were dropped off in front of the theater in Times Square. It was a sunny, spring day and camp counsellors lined us up under the marquee while they got the tickets from the box office. Then they let us goof around and hang out in the alleyway next to the theater between 44th and 45th Street while we all waited for the theater to open. It was clearly the first showing of the day.

In the alleyway, everyone gravitated to their own pre-tween cliques as usual. I sat down with this kid named Rob. We got along because we were both oddballs that didn’t live in Trump Village like the rest of the kids yet still went to the day camp run out of Trump Village.

With our backs pressed against the alley wall and our knees folded, we both stared intently at the lobby cards in the glass display case just outside the theater door. The lobby cards were placed in the display case with no particular magic, rhyme or reason; they were just generic pictures of scenes from _Star Wars_ with a nice border of tinsel or glitter around them. One shot showed the first appearance of Darth Vader at the beginning of the film; standing there with hands on his hips, surrounded by dead Rebel soldiers and Stomtroopers after just boarding the captured Rebel ship.

“What do you think of this one?” I asked pokihg Rob and motioning to the lobby cards. “I don’t know.” He shrugged. The thing with these movie “field trips” was that if the movie stank — and a lot of them stank — it basically meant about 90 minutes of time in the dark dealing with bulliee, horsing around and related nonsense. So I kept on looking at the lobby cards — trying to figure out what the film was about — and waited.

A counsellor clapped his hands and shouted, “Okay! Everybody! Line up!” And we did while the theater staff unlocked the entrance doors. We filed into the theater lobby through the noticeably awkward alley entrance which didn’t seem like anything special. But the second we walked into the theater itself, everything was clearly different: The theater was huge! Easily the largest theater I had ever been in and my previous benchmark was the Oceana in Brighton Beach where I saw _The Bad News Bears_ before they chopped that place up into a multiplex.

We all walked down the aisle on the left-hand side of the theater and piled into two or three rows near the middle of the left side of the theater. There were some other people there, but not many.

Everyone sat down and the typical horsing around and bullshit happened. The kids who had enough money to buy soda and candy, had their candy and showed it off by tossing bits of it at the poorer kids like me. Chairs were kicked, people were shoved and some were even punched. Then the curtains were slowly pulled back and the lights dimmed.

The screen was easily the biggest screen I ever saw in my young life; which made sense since the theater itself was so huge. But still the impact of actually seeing that screen light up was tremendous.

Before the movie started — but while the screen was lit up with a trailer, teaser or something — there was still some horsing around happening. That horsing around continued a bit during the 20th Century Fox opening fanfare. But when the main titles hit — with the big “Lucasfilm Limited” text projected in green letters — the tone changed. Everyone’s eyes were fixed on the screen.

Then when the huge, yellow “Star Wars” text blew onto the screen followed by the opening crawl absolutely everyone was into it and sat still. This was literally the first film where everyone — kids and counsellors — shut up and paid attention to the film right from the outset. Then when the film actually began and the tiny rebel ship was being chased by the gigantic Star Destroyer that filled the whole screen, that settled it. Everyone was 1,000,000% into the film.

When the movie ended it was an amazing testament to the power of myth and magic that 100% nobody was getting harassed or beaten up — or harassing and beating other people up — and everyone was fairly stunned and talking enthusiastically about the film. The film made everyone forget how to be jerks for a while.

As we left the theater, the first thing I noticed were some arcade games tucked in a corner. I loved arcade games and they were always on my radar. These were some tank or combat inspired games since they had some weird controls. I ran over to check them out — as a counsellor yelled at me to get back in line — but they were unplugged or out of order. Dejected, I walked back in the line with everyone else and kept on walking. Soon we came near a table where everyone was hovering around and looking at something.

It was a crappy metal card table with a red cloth thrown over that had some copies of _Star Wars_ movie programs strewn across it for sale. There was some theater worker wearing an official vest with his name tag on it awkwardly standing behind the table waiting for us kids to give him our money. There was a metal cash box near him filled with bills and change.

I never saw a movie program before. These specifically were about the size of a record album. I think they were being sold for something like $4 a piece and had some cool pictures from the film in them which was a big deal. In those days cable TV didn’t exist and video rental stores — let alone VCRs — were not commonplace. So if you wanted to remember a movie after you saw it, pictures printed on paper in something you bought was the way you did that. But for a kid like me $4 was two weeks’ worth of allowance and I only had about a dollar and some change on me. So I had to pass. Predictably, the same richer kids who could afford soda and candy got programs and were pretty selfish and arrogant about it. So I wouldn’t be able to ask any of them to borrow a copy of their program to flip through on the bus ride back home. I didn’t float in their social groups and that was the end of that.

When we left the theater, the sun on the street was bright and there was another table out on the sidewalk with more stuff for sale. It didn’t seem like an official sanctioned souvenir stand, but just something some fans decided to do on a whim. The table itself was yet another crappy card table, but I remember it being covered with a gingham tablecloth and filled with buttons and metal jewelry inspired by _Star Wars_. The guy behind the table looked like a hippie, but was a bit cleaner. Some of the stuff he was selling looked cool, but nothing really appealed to me. So I got back on the bus with everyone else, grabbed a window seat and we all headed back to Brooklyn.

When I got home, I was really excited to tell dad about _Star Wars_. He knew about the film since it was making some small buzz on the news. From that day forward, anytime he caught something on TV that showed scenes from _Star Wars_ — even if it was just a commercial — he let me know so I could run into the living room to see it.

The next day wasn’t a camp day; maybe it was the weekend? Anyway, on one of my trips to the corner newsstand to check out comics I remember seeing packs of _Star Wars_ bubble gum trading cards for 25 cents a piece. I could afford that! So instead of buying a comic, I got two packs of trading cards for 50 cents.

The gum was horrible, but the pictures and stickers brought back memories.
