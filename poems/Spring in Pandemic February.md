Spring in Pandemic February

The day feels nice.  
Everyone is wearing less than before.  
Some seem chilly, but some seem optimistic.  
Warmth comes from the sunlight.

Some wear masks, done don’t.  
Eye contact on the subway with a mask feels tense.

Everything feels hyper, yet calm.  
Exhausting, yet comforting.  
Energetic, yet lazily laconic.

Get off at Canal Street and head to Walker Street.  
Spot construction area.  
Sneak in to take a piss.

Walk out, avoid piles of human crap.  
Gallery a few doors down.  
Art looks like bespoke dorm room neon.

Walk down to Cortlandt Alley.  
Head back to Canal Street.  
Quick stop into an art space near McDonald’s.

Feels weird to go above the first floor of any place on Canal Street.  
See what can be seen.  
Leave, head back to the street.

Construction makes subway a bit extra today.  
Notice all of the old shops with “for rent” signs.  
Chinese women standing around with laminated bootleg good guides on them.

No real energy to them.  
They just stand there.  
While others sell the same stuff literally on the street next to them.

Toy frog endlessly swimming n plastic bucket beneath tourist junk.  
Always moving forward but in the same place.  
In the same city.  
On the same street.  
On the same block.
