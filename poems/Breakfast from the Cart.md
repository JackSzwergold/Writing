## Breakfast from the Cart

By Jack Szwergold, March 30, 2016

Sausage and egg on a roll.<br />
Salt and pepper.<br />
<br />
Add some hot sauce and cut out a piece of cardboard from the box the stuff came in.<br />
Then crumble up some of the aluminum foil into the shape of a metal pattie, step on it and put it on top of everything else.<br />
<br />
Hold a coffee lid under the coffee nozzle and let it run a bit.<br />
Shake it off an put it on top of that.<br />
<br />
See that sprinkled doughnut there?<br />
No that one.<br />
<br />
Okay, now cut it in half laterally and put the top half on top of the sandwich.<br />
The bottom half should be ripped to shreds and given to the pigeons as an offering because they are God’s creatures and better than all of us.<br />
<br />
Now warm up a large cup of diet Peach Snapple and pour it into the “to go” mug I just gave you.<br />
Have it all delivered to my office in 2 hours on a nice, fancy pillow and we’re all good.
