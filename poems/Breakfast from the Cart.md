## Breakfast from the Cart

By Jack Szwergold

***

Sausage and egg on a roll.  
Salt and pepper.

Add some hot sauce and cut out a piece of cardboard from the box the stuff came in.  
Then crumble up some of the aluminum foil into the shape of a metal pattie, step on it and put it on top of everything else.

Hold a coffee lid under the coffee nozzle and let it run a bit.  
Shake it off an put it on top of that.

See that sprinkled doughnut there?  
No that one.

Okay, now cut it in half laterally and put the top half on top of the sandwich.  
The bottom half should be ripped to shreds and given to the pigeons as an offering because they are God’s creatures and better than all of us.

Now warm up a large cup of diet Peach Snapple and pour it into the “to go” mug I just gave you.  
Have it all delivered to my office in 2 hours on a nice, fancy pillow and we’re all good.
