## Centipede (1981)

By Jack Szwergold

Played *Centipede* for the first time at an arcade called *Captainâ€™s Quarters* that opened up on Brighton Beach Avenue near Coney Island Avenue; just down the block from *Forty Thieves*. It was a fun game mainly because of the trackball; slamming it to roll rom side to side was a cool experience.
