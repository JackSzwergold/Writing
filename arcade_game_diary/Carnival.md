## Carnival (1980)

By Jack Szwergold

Played *Carnival* when I went on a trip to Vermont with some school friends and we stopped at a local arcade. The graphics of the game looked cool in the magazines I read, but the gameplay was stiff and a bit boring. Just like a shooting gallery, but in a video game form but with no prizes.
