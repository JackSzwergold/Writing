## Space Invaders (1978)

By Jack Szwergold

The first time I played *Space Invaders* was at the *Forty Thieves* candy store on the corner of Brighton Beach Avenue and Coney Island Avenue. It was one of three arcade games *Forty Thieves* had—*Gorf*, *Bite Monster (Pac-Man clone)* and *Space Invaders*—and utterly nobody played *Space Invaders* since it seemed old and out of date: *Gorf* was basically *Space Invaders* with more options/levels and *Bite Monster* was the star of the trio of games since everyone had *Pac-Man* fever or something like that. I did like one thing about *Space Invaders*: The sound design. The deep bass of the aliens thumping down across the screen and the sheer shimmering sound of lasers being fired was something unique that I never heard in any other video games of the time.
