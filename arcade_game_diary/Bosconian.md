## Bosconian (1981)

By Jack Szwergold

The first time I played this game was at *Faberâ€™s Fascination* in Coney Island on Neptune Avenue near Surf Avenue. The game was cool because you could explore and scroll through the small space scene the gameplay took place in. Destroying space stations was not cool. And sadly I was mugged by two other kids around my age on Henderson Walk just outside of the arcade as I was trying to go home. They basically just pushed me against the wall and threatened me, and I gave them the two measly dollars I had left. Walked back to the boardwalk and cried all the way home to Ocean Parkway.
