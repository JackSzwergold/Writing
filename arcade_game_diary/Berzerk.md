## Berzerk (1980)

By Jack Szwergold

The first time I played *Berzerk* was in this discount store on Brighton Beach Avenue—near Coney Island Avenue—that was eventually called *Bertas* but had some generic sounding discount store name when I played this game there. It was weird since they spread out a few arcade games to wherever they could plug one in. And *Berzerk* was facing the far wall away from the windows—where other arcade games were setup—and away from the main entrance.
