## Battlezone (1980)

By Jack Szwergold

I believe the first time I played *Battlezone* might have been in 1979 or 1980 at this arcade called *Captain’s Quarters* that opened up on Brighton Beach Avenue near Coney Island Avenue; just down the block from *Forty Thieves*. But another part of me seems to recall first playing this game in Coney Island at the *Faber’s Fascination* arcade on Surf Avenue near Neptune Avenue across the street from the subway station.
