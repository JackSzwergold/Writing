# Arcade Game Diary

This section is a placeholder for memories connected to arcade games I liked—and still like—dating from 1977 to 1985. At this point, it’s here mainly to motivate me to actually sit down and write about them already.

***

## 1977

#### [Boot Hill (1977)](Boot%20Hill)

Some memories of the first vide game I ever played.

#### [Starhawk (1977)](Starhawk)

Starhawk was a crappy *Star Wars* rip off of a video game, but I still liked it.

## 1978

#### [Space Invaders (1978)](Space%20Invaders)

The first time I played *Space Invaders* I was bored with it because there were already better options out there.

## 1979

#### [Asteroids (1979)](Asteroids)

The first time I played *Asteroids* was in 1979 or 1980 at this arcade called *Captain’s Quarters*.

#### [Lunar Lander (1979)](Lunar%20Lander)

All of the video game magazines out there talked about *Lunar Lander* so I was obsessed with playing it.

## 1980

#### [Battlezone (1980)](Battlezone)

Playing *Battlezone* was pretty cool.

#### [Berzerk (1980)](Battlezone)

*Berzerk* was the first “running and shooting people in a maze” game I ever played.

#### [Bite Monster (Pac-Man clone) (1980)](Bite%20Monster)

*Bite Monster* was a *Pac-Man* clone that I played before I knew what *Pac-Man* was.

#### [Carnival (1980)](Carnival)

*Carnival* was a boring shooting gallery game, but I read up on it and had to play it.

#### [Defender (1980)](Defender)

The first time I played *Defender* was at this sketchy storefront on Neptune Avenue around Brighton 3rd Street.

#### [Missile Command (1980)](Missile%20Command)

The first time I played *Missile Command* was at this arcade called *Captain’s Quarters* that opened up on Brighton Beach Avenue near Coney Island Avenue.

#### [Moon Cresta (1980)](Moon%20Cresta)

The first time I played *Moon Cresta* was in this discount store on Brighton Beach Avenue near Coney Island Avenue.

#### [Phoenix (1980)](Phoenix)

*Phoenix* was a cool shooting game that combined some elements of *Star Wars* and *Star Blazers*.

#### [Star Castle (1980)](Star%20Castle)

The first time I played *Star Castle* was at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island on Neptune Avenue near Surf Avenue.

#### [Wizard of Wor (1980)](Wizard%20of%20Wor)

The first time I played *Wizard of Wor* was at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island on Neptune Avenue near Surf Avenue. The game was fun but that’s about it.

## 1981

#### [Bosconian (1981)](Bosconian)

I played *Bosconian* in Coney Island and got mugged.

#### [Centipede (1981)](Centipede)

Played *Centipede* for the first time at an arcade called *Captain’s Quarters* that opened up on Brighton Beach Avenue near Coney Island Avenue.

#### [Donkey Kong (1981)](Donkey%20Kong)

The first time I ever played *Donkey Kong* was at Met Food; the supermarket across the street from me on Brighton Beach Avenue and Ocean Parkway.

#### [Gorf (1981)](Gorf)

*Gorf* was a great value of a junior high school kid with limited funds who wanted to play a variety of games for a single quarter.

#### [Ms. Pac Man (1981)](Ms%20Pac-Man)

The first time I played *Ms. Pac-Man* was in Harrison, NJ.

#### [Vanguard (1981)](Vanguard)

The first time I played *Vanguard* was at some corner grocery store on Neptune Avenue near Brighton 2nd Street.

## 1982

#### Donkey Kong Jr. (1982)

The first time I played *Donkey Kong Jr.* was at the Kings Plaza Mall which was located deep in Brooklyn near Canarsie in this neighborhood called Mill Basin. The game was one of many new games at the mall’s smallish, unenclosed arcade which was basically just a row of arcade machines near a Roy Rogers or some fast food place like that.

#### Firefox (1982)

The first time I played *Firefox* was at the Astroland arcade which was on West 10th Street near Neptune Avenue in Coney Island; right across the way from the *Dante’s Inferno* dark ride. It was an outdoor arcade that had some kind of overhead shade, but otherwise was wide open and you could just walk through it without hassle. The game looked cool since it used actual footage from the motion picture it was based on, but the gameplay kind of sucked. I remember playing the game and Victor—this guy who was older than me who was the son of my mom’s friend in the building—spotted me and said, “These games are fun, right?” I nodded in agreement and he walked off to hang out with a friend of his (William?) who would hang out on the boardwalk and ogle the girls on the beach via a telephoto lens camera one of them had. Family friends but kind of creepy, right?

#### Joust (1982)

I barely remember the first time I played *Joust* but I was really into it. It might have been at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island on Neptune Avenue near Surf Avenue… but not too sure.

#### Moon Patrol (1982)

The first time I played *Moon Patrol* was at the *Forty Thieves* candy store on the corner of Brighton Beach Avenue and Coney Island Avenue. They had the machine outside of their store and facing Brighton Beach Avenue itself which made gameplay awkward—if not impossible—on bright and sunny days. The game itself was fun since it introduced the idea of jumping an driving as well as shooting aliens to the mix. Graphics and music were cool too.

#### Mr. Do (1982)

Of all of the games I ever played as a kid, *Mr. Do* was the one I was truly most obsessed with. I first played it at some candy store on Neptune Avenue near Brighton 6th or 5th street or something like that. This was literally the only arcade game they had in this small, well stocked, completely legit shop and they took good care of it. The owners would gladly provide kids with change for the machines and the kids would gladly buy some of the affordable snacks the shop had. I was obsessed with *Mr. Do* because the gameplay was fast, the graphics were cute and while it was technically a *Dig Dug* clone, it was just much more fun to play. And there were all kinds of bonuses. I don’t remember the exact high scores I made, but was pretty high for a kid on an arcade machine in a dumpy neighborhood and other kids were impressed so I was happy: Finally I could earn some level of basic respect from other neighborhood kids by playing a simple video game!

#### Pole Position (1982)

I barely remember the first place I played *Pole Position*. Maybe it was  *Rainbow Lanes*, a bowling alley in Sheepshead Bay? Don’t know but leaving this here until the memory pops back into my head.

#### Robotron 2084 (1982)

The first time I played *Robotron 2084* was at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island on Neptune Avenue near Surf Avenue. The game was fun because coordinating between the left joystick that controlled your movement and the right joystick that controlled your firing direction was difficult to get a hang of but still a fun skill to learn. The onscreen graphics were also fluid and cool. And while the gameplay could get insane on higher levels, it was still a fun ride to be on.

#### Tutankham (1982)

The first time I played *Tutankham* was at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island on Neptune Avenue near Surf Avenue. The game was fun but that’s about it.

#### Xevious (1982)

First time I played *Xevious* was in this candy store on Neptune Avenue near Ocean Parkway; right near Lincoln High School. Pretty sure I first played it when I was going home after being let out on some day during my sophomore year in the school. The candy store was cool and had a few arcade games near the back. But the back of the store was kind of sketchy. I think they only had 3 video games in there at any given time and at one point even had *Dragon’s Lair* which was a big deal since it was a laserdisc video game that was completely animated and had no digital arcade-like characters in it.

## 1983

#### Gyruss (1983)

*Gyruss* was a cool clone of *Tempest* that used raster graphics instead of vector graphics. It was fun since the gameplay also felt like a 3D version of *Galaga*. I am not 100% on where I first played *Gyruss* but I am pretty sure it was at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island… But part of me thinks I first played the game in the student union building at Brooklyn College; the basement of the place had a full-on arcade with all kinds of cool games like *The Empire Strikes Back*, *Gyruss*, *Mappy* and even that creepy shooting game *Chiller*.

#### Star Wars (1983)

The first time I played *Star Wars* was at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island on Neptune Avenue near Surf Avenue. The machine was the sit-down model of the game so it cost 50 cents to play—instead of the 25 cents for the stand-up model—but it was well worth it to feel like you were in the cockpit of an X-Wing fighter. Destroying the Death Star was fun, but as each level progressed the game got boring. Maneuvering around towers on the Death Star’s surface on higher levels was fun, but past that it just played faster and faster of the same theme. How many times can you destroy the Death Star before you feel you can just go home already?

## 1985

#### The Empire Strikes Back (1985)

The first time I played *The Empire Strikes Back* was at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island on Neptune Avenue near Surf Avenue. Pretty certain it was the stand up model of the game. It had similar vector graphics to what the original *Star Wars* game had, but this game was way more fun. Being able to fly through the legs of AT-AT’s was really great and one of the most fun 3D game experiences I ever had.

#### Gauntlet (1985)

The first time I ever played *Gauntlet* was at a drug store in Midwood on the corner of Coney Island Avenue and Avenue J. The drugstore was right outside of the B68 bus stop so this game was the perfect way to waste some time. And it was pretty cool since it was the first arcade game I knew of where multiple people (up to 4) can play at the same time and work cooperatively to reach a goal. It was a bit of an “evil” game since your character didn’t die, but would lose “health” by being attacked and you could boost your health by sticking another quarter in. Fun game, but it seemed endless and tossing quarters into it endlessly got to be annoying after a while.
