# Arcade Game Diary

This section is a placeholder for memories connected to arcade games I liked—and still like—dating from 1977 to 1985. At this point, it’s here mainly to motivate me to actually sit down and write about them already.

#### Asteroids (1979)

The first time I played *Asteroids* was in 1979 or 1980 at this arcade called *Captain’s Quarters* that opened up on Brighton Beach Avenue near Coney Island Avenue; just down the block from *Forty Thieves*.

#### Battlezone (1980)

I believe the first time I played * Battlezone* might have been in 1979 or 1980 at this arcade called *Captain’s Quarters* that opened up on Brighton Beach Avenue near Coney Island Avenue; just down the block from *Forty Thieves*. But another part of me seems to recall first playing this game in Coney Island at the *Faber’s Fascination* arcade on Surf Avenue near Neptune Avenue across the street from the subway station.
