# Arcade Game Diary

This section is a placeholder for memories connected to arcade games I liked—and still like—dating from 1977 to 1985. At this point, it’s here mainly to motivate me to actually sit down and write about them already.

***

## 1977

#### [Boot Hill (1977)](Boot%20Hill)

Some memories of the first vide game I ever played.

#### [Starhawk (1977)](Starhawk)

Starhawk was a crappy *Star Wars* rip off of a video game, but I still liked it.

## 1978

#### [Space Invaders (1978)](Space%20Invaders)

The first time I played *Space Invaders* I was bored with it because there were already better options out there.

## 1979

#### [Asteroids (1979)](Asteroids)

The first time I played *Asteroids* was in 1979 or 1980 at this arcade called *Captain’s Quarters*.

#### [Lunar Lander (1979)](Lunar%20Lander)

All of the video game magazines out there talked about *Lunar Lander* so I was obsessed with playing it.

## 1980

#### [Battlezone (1980)](Battlezone)

Playing *Battlezone* was pretty cool.

#### [Berzerk (1980)](Battlezone)

*Berzerk* was the first “running and shooting people in a maze” game I ever played.

*Bite Monster* was a *Pac-Man* clone that I played before I knew what *Pac-Man* was.

#### [Carnival (1980)](Carnival)

*Carnival* was a boring shooting gallery game, but I read up on it and had to play it.

#### [Defender (1980)](Defender)

The first time I played *Defender* was at this sketchy storefront on Neptune Avenue around Brighton 3rd Street.

#### [Missile Command (1980)](Missile%20Command)

The first time I played *Missile Command* was at this arcade called *Captain’s Quarters* that opened up on Brighton Beach Avenue near Coney Island Avenue.

#### [Moon Cresta (1980)](Moon%20Cresta)

The first time I played *Moon Cresta* was in this discount store on Brighton Beach Avenue near Coney Island Avenue.

#### [Phoenix (1980)](Phoenix)

*Phoenix* was a cool shooting game that combined some elements of *Star Wars* and *Star Blazers*.

#### [Star Castle (1980)](Star%20Castle)

The first time I played *Star Castle* was at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island on Neptune Avenue near Surf Avenue.

#### [Wizard of Wor (1980)](Wizard%20of%20Wor)

The first time I played *Wizard of Wor* was at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island on Neptune Avenue near Surf Avenue. The game was fun but that’s about it.

## 1981

#### [Bosconian (1981)](Bosconian)

I played *Bosconian* in Coney Island and got mugged.

#### [Centipede (1981)](Centipede)

Played *Centipede* for the first time at an arcade called *Captain’s Quarters* that opened up on Brighton Beach Avenue near Coney Island Avenue.

#### [Donkey Kong (1981)](Donkey%20Kong)

The first time I ever played *Donkey Kong* was at Met Food; the supermarket across the street from me on Brighton Beach Avenue and Ocean Parkway.

#### [Gorf (1981)](Gorf)

*Gorf* was a great value of a junior high school kid with limited funds who wanted to play a variety of games for a single quarter.

#### [Ms. Pac Man (1981)](Ms%20Pac-Man)

The first time I played *Ms. Pac-Man* was in Harrison, NJ.

#### [Vanguard (1981)](Vanguard)

The first time I played *Vanguard* was at some corner grocery store on Neptune Avenue near Brighton 2nd Street.

## 1982

#### [Donkey Kong Jr. (1982)](Donkey%20Kong%20Jr)

The first time I played *Donkey Kong Jr.* was at the Kings Plaza Mall which was located deep in Brooklyn near Canarsie in this neighborhood called Mill Basin.

#### [Firefox (1982)](Firefox)

The first time I played *Firefox* was at the Astroland arcade which was on West 10th Street near Neptune Avenue in Coney Island; right across the way from the *Dante’s Inferno* dark ride.

#### [Joust (1982)](Joust)

I barely remember the first time I played *Joust* but I was really into it. It might have been at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island on Neptune Avenue near Surf Avenue… but not too sure.

#### [Moon Patrol (1982)](Moon%20Patrol)

The first time I played *Moon Patrol* was at the *Forty Thieves* candy store on the corner of Brighton Beach Avenue and Coney Island Avenue.

#### [Mr. Do (1982)](Mr%20Do)

Of all of the games I ever played as a kid, *Mr. Do* was the one I was truly most obsessed with.

#### [Pole Position (1982)](Pole%20Position)

I barely remember the first place I played *Pole Position*.

#### [Robotron 2084 (1982)](Robotron%202084)

The first time I played *Robotron 2084* was at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island on Neptune Avenue near Surf Avenue.

#### [Tutankham (1982)](Tutankham)

The first time I played *Tutankham* was at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island on Neptune Avenue near Surf Avenue. The game was fun but that’s about it.

#### [Xevious (1982)](Xevious)

First time I played *Xevious* was in this candy store on Neptune Avenue near Ocean Parkway; right near Lincoln High School.

## 1983

#### Gyruss (1983)

*Gyruss* was a cool clone of *Tempest* that used raster graphics instead of vector graphics. It was fun since the gameplay also felt like a 3D version of *Galaga*. I am not 100% on where I first played *Gyruss* but I am pretty sure it was at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island… But part of me thinks I first played the game in the student union building at Brooklyn College; the basement of the place had a full-on arcade with all kinds of cool games like *The Empire Strikes Back*, *Gyruss*, *Mappy* and even that creepy shooting game *Chiller*.

#### Star Wars (1983)

The first time I played *Star Wars* was at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island on Neptune Avenue near Surf Avenue. The machine was the sit-down model of the game so it cost 50 cents to play—instead of the 25 cents for the stand-up model—but it was well worth it to feel like you were in the cockpit of an X-Wing fighter. Destroying the Death Star was fun, but as each level progressed the game got boring. Maneuvering around towers on the Death Star’s surface on higher levels was fun, but past that it just played faster and faster of the same theme. How many times can you destroy the Death Star before you feel you can just go home already?

## 1985

#### The Empire Strikes Back (1985)

The first time I played *The Empire Strikes Back* was at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island on Neptune Avenue near Surf Avenue. Pretty certain it was the stand up model of the game. It had similar vector graphics to what the original *Star Wars* game had, but this game was way more fun. Being able to fly through the legs of AT-AT’s was really great and one of the most fun 3D game experiences I ever had.

#### Gauntlet (1985)

The first time I ever played *Gauntlet* was at a drug store in Midwood on the corner of Coney Island Avenue and Avenue J. The drugstore was right outside of the B68 bus stop so this game was the perfect way to waste some time. And it was pretty cool since it was the first arcade game I knew of where multiple people (up to 4) can play at the same time and work cooperatively to reach a goal. It was a bit of an “evil” game since your character didn’t die, but would lose “health” by being attacked and you could boost your health by sticking another quarter in. Fun game, but it seemed endless and tossing quarters into it endlessly got to be annoying after a while.
