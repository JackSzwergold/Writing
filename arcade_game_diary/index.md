# Arcade Game Diary

This section is a placeholder for memories connected to arcade games I liked—and still like—dating from 1977 to 1985. At this point, it’s here mainly to motivate me to actually sit down and write about them already.

***

#### Asteroids (1979)

The first time I played *Asteroids* was in 1979 or 1980 at this arcade called *Captain’s Quarters* that opened up on Brighton Beach Avenue near Coney Island Avenue; just down the block from *Forty Thieves*.

#### Battlezone (1980)

I believe the first time I played *Battlezone* might have been in 1979 or 1980 at this arcade called *Captain’s Quarters* that opened up on Brighton Beach Avenue near Coney Island Avenue; just down the block from *Forty Thieves*. But another part of me seems to recall first playing this game in Coney Island at the *Faber’s Fascination* arcade on Surf Avenue near Neptune Avenue across the street from the subway station.

#### Berzerk (1980)

The first time I played *Berzerk* was in this discount store on Brighton Beach Avenue that was eventually called *Bertas* but had some generic sounding discount store name. It was weird since they spread out a few arcade games to wherever they could plug one in. And *Berzerk* was facing the far wall away from the windows—where other arcade games were setup—and away from the main entrance.

#### Bite Monster (Pac-Man clone) (1980)

*Bite Monster* was this weird—and aparently German made—*Pac-Man* clone they had at the *Forty Thieves* candy store on the corner of Brighton Beach Avenue and Coney Island Avenue. Gameplay was the same as *Pac-Man* but the game cabinet itself was a but junky. Like the joystick was really wobbly compared to even a real *Pac-Man* machine and the metal control panel where the joystick was placed was loose. So kids who put their quarters up on the console often had them slip behind that metal part which meant we had to complain to the store owner who would give a kid a new quarter but still complain about it. Until I saw a real *Pac-Man* machine, I always thought this game was called *Bite Monster*.

#### Boot Hill (1977)

The first actual video game I ever played. I spotted it at Nathan’s in Time Square on Broadway and 45th Street; the building now is the home to NASDAQ headquarters. Me and my dad were going to Nathan’s one day to check out the puppet show they had in the basement for kids. It was a pretty decent puppet show and every so often we would go; admission was free and I might score a hot dog. As we walked into to the building, I spotted *Boot Hill* near the front of the place and was basically hypnotized by it. Simple cowboy shootout setup with one gunner on one side of the screen and a gunner on the other. But it looked cool since it had some reflected background that was painted to look like some desolate old west town. The gameplay kinda sucked, but the whole experience felt cool and fun.

#### Bosconian (1981)

The first time I played this game was at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island on Neptune Avenue near Surf Avenue. The game was cool because you could explore and scroll through the small space scene the gameplay took place in. Destroying space stations was not cool. And sadly I was mugged by two other kids around my age on Henderson Walk just outside of the arcade as I was trying to go home. They basically just pushed me against the wall and threatened me, and I gave them the two measley dollars I had left. Walked back to the boardwalk and cried all the way home to Ocean Parkway.

#### Carnival (1980)

Played *Carnival* when I went on a trip to Vermont with some school friends and we stopped at a local arcade. The graphics of the game looked cool in the magazines I read, but the gameplay was stiff and a bit boring. Just like a shooting gallery, but in a video game form but with no prizes.
