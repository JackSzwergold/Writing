# Arcade Game Diary

This section is a placeholder for memories connected to arcade games I liked—and still like—dating from 1977 to 1985. At this point, it’s here mainly to motivate me to actually sit down and write about them already.

***

#### Asteroids (1979)

The first time I played *Asteroids* was in 1979 or 1980 at this arcade called *Captain’s Quarters* that opened up on Brighton Beach Avenue near Coney Island Avenue; just down the block from *Forty Thieves*.

#### Battlezone (1980)

I believe the first time I played *Battlezone* might have been in 1979 or 1980 at this arcade called *Captain’s Quarters* that opened up on Brighton Beach Avenue near Coney Island Avenue; just down the block from *Forty Thieves*. But another part of me seems to recall first playing this game in Coney Island at the *Faber’s Fascination* arcade on Surf Avenue near Neptune Avenue across the street from the subway station.

#### Berzerk (1980)

The first time I played *Berzerk* was in this discount store on Brighton Beach Avenue—near Coney Island Avenue—that was eventually called *Bertas* but had some generic sounding discount store name when I played this game there. It was weird since they spread out a few arcade games to wherever they could plug one in. And *Berzerk* was facing the far wall away from the windows—where other arcade games were setup—and away from the main entrance.

#### Bite Monster (Pac-Man clone) (1980)

*Bite Monster* was this weird—and aparently German made—*Pac-Man* clone they had at the *Forty Thieves* candy store on the corner of Brighton Beach Avenue and Coney Island Avenue. Gameplay was the same as *Pac-Man* but the game cabinet itself was a but junky. Like the joystick was really wobbly compared to even a real *Pac-Man* machine and the metal control panel where the joystick was placed was loose. So kids who put their quarters up on the console often had them slip behind that metal part which meant we had to complain to the store owner who would give a kid a new quarter but still complain about it. Until I saw a real *Pac-Man* machine, I always thought this game was called *Bite Monster*.

#### Boot Hill (1977)

The first actual video game I ever played. I spotted it at Nathan’s in Time Square on Broadway and 45th Street; the building now is the home to NASDAQ headquarters. Me and my dad were going to Nathan’s one day to check out the puppet show they had in the basement for kids. It was a pretty decent puppet show and every so often we would go; admission was free and I might score a hot dog. As we walked into to the building, I spotted *Boot Hill* near the front of the place and was basically hypnotized by it. Simple cowboy shootout setup with one gunner on one side of the screen and a gunner on the other. But it looked cool since it had some reflected background that was painted to look like some desolate old west town. The gameplay kinda sucked, but the whole experience felt cool and fun.

#### Bosconian (1981)

The first time I played this game was at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island on Neptune Avenue near Surf Avenue. The game was cool because you could explore and scroll through the small space scene the gameplay took place in. Destroying space stations was not cool. And sadly I was mugged by two other kids around my age on Henderson Walk just outside of the arcade as I was trying to go home. They basically just pushed me against the wall and threatened me, and I gave them the two measley dollars I had left. Walked back to the boardwalk and cried all the way home to Ocean Parkway.

#### Carnival (1980)

Played *Carnival* when I went on a trip to Vermont with some school friends and we stopped at a local arcade. The graphics of the game looked cool in the magazines I read, but the gameplay was stiff and a bit boring. Just like a shooting gallery, but in a video game form but with no prizes.

#### Centipede (1981)

Played *Centipede* for the first time at an arcade called *Captain’s Quarters* that opened up on Brighton Beach Avenue near Coney Island Avenue; just down the block from *Forty Thieves*. It was a fun game mainly because of the trackball; slamming it to roll rom side to side was a cool experience.

#### Defender (1980)

Played *Defender* for the first time at this sketchy storefront on Neptune Avenue around Brighton 3rd Street. It was sketchy because it was a small, dark storefront with utterly nothing else in the place but a soda machine, some random chairs and this arcade machine. It’s like some anti-social loser was friends with the owner of the building and they just let them open a crazy storefront just with one video game in it: *Defender*. The game was fun to play, but intense. What was also intense is most of the time me and friends would go inside to play it, there was seemingly nobody inside the store. One time we were playing it and this guy with blonde hair who looked a bit handsome—but a bit “junkie”-ish—came out from the back area of the store to stand behind us and say, “That’s a fun game, right?” And then would head back into the back of the store. The place never creeped me out enough for me to stop going there. What did get me to stop going there was just the fact that *Defender* was just too intense for me to deal with.

#### Donkey Kong (1981)

The first time I ever played *Donkey Kong* was at Met Food; the supermarket across the street from me on Brighton Beach Avenue and Ocean Parkway. I was walking down the block to head to either the library, toy store or bookstore and noticed the cabinent near the main entrance. I walked in and saw one a kid I knew in school, Aaron, playing the game. I looked over his shoulders and it looked cool. The characters seemed cool and it looked a little bit like Popeye. Aaron asked me as he was playing, “You ever play this before, Jack?” I shook my head to say “No…” and he kept on playing.  After he was done, he pulled out some pre-printed sports gambling pad he had in is pocket. “Do you like football, Jack?” I turned to him and said “No…” and with that he put the pad back in his pocket, said goodbye to me and headed outside. After he left, I took a quarter out of my pocket and tossed it in the machine to play *Donkey Kong* myself. The game was fun, but it seemed repetetive.

#### Donkey Kong Jr. (1982)

The first time I played *Donkey Kong Jr.* was at the Kings Plaza Mall which was located deep in Brooklyn near Canarsie in this neighborhood called Mill Basin. The game was one of many new games at the mall’s smallish, unenclosed arcade which was basically just a row of arcade machines near a Roy Rogers or some fast food place like that.

#### The Empire Strikes Back (1985)

The first time I played *The Empire Strikes Back* was at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island on Neptune Avenue near Surf Avenue. Pretty certain it was the stand up model of the game. It had simialr vector graphics to what the original *Star Wars* game had, but this game was way more fun. Being able to fly through the legs of AT-AT’s was really great and one of the most fun 3D game experiences I ever had.

#### Firefox (1982)

The first time I played *Firefox* was at the Astroland arcade which was on West 10th Street near Neptune Avenue in Coney Island; right across the way from the *Dante’s Inferno* dark ride. It was an outdoor arcade that had some kind of overhead shade, but otherwise was wide open and you could just walk through it without hassle. The game looked cool since it used actual footage from the motion picture it was based on, but the gameplay kind of sucked. I remember playing the game and Victor—this guy who was older than me who was the son of my mom’s friend in the building—spotted me and said, “These games are fun, right?” I nodded in agreement and he walked off to hang out with a friend of his (William?) who would hang out on the boardwalk and oggle the girls on the beach via a telephoto lens camera one of them had. Family friends but kind of creepy, right?

#### Gauntlet (1985)

The first time I ever played *Gauntlet* was at a drug store in Midwood on the corner of Coney Island Aveneue and Avenue J. The drugstore was right outside of the B68 bus stop so this game was the perfect way to waste some time. And it was pretty cool since it was the first arcade game I knew of where multiple people (up to 4) can play at the same time and work cooperatively to reach a goal. It was a bit of an “evil” game since your character didn’t die, but would lose “health” by being attacked and you could boost your health by sticking another quarter in. Fun game, but it seemed endless and tossing quarters into it endlessly got to be annoying after a while.

#### Gorf (1981)

*Gorf* was a great value of a junior high school kid with limited funds who wanted to play a variety of games for a single quarter. The first time I played it was at the *Forty Thieves* candy store on the corner of Brighton Beach Avenue and Coney Island Avenue. It was one of three games they had at the time: *Space Invaders*, *Bite Monster (Pac-Man Clone)* and *Gorf*. *Gorf* was fun to play since it had five levels, started off like *Space Invaders* and had a level later on that was just like *Galaxian*. It’s weird this candy store would have *Gorf* and *Space Invaders* since why would anyone play *Space Invaders* when they could play *Gorf* instead. The game also talked to you to taunt you and the controller was a joystick with a trigger on it that looked/felt like a fighter pilot’s control stick. The one thing that did stink about *Gorf* is how unsmooth the gameplay was; it was like it was programmed in some clunky language like Forth or something and never optimized for speed.

#### Gyruss (1983)

*Gyruss* was a cool clone of *Tempest* that used raster graphics instead of vector graphics. It was fun since the gameplay also felt like a 3D version of *Galga*. I am not 100% on where I first played *Gyruss* but I am pretty sure it was at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island… But part of me thinks I first played the game in the student union building at Brooklyn College; the basement of the place had a full-on arcade with all kinds of cool games like *The Empire Strikes Back*, *Gyruss*, *Mappy* and even that creepy shooting game *Chiller*.

#### Joust (1982)

I barely remember the first time I played *Joust* but I was really into it. It might have been at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island on Neptune Avenue near Surf Avenue… but not too sure.

#### Lunar Lander (1979)

I was a little bit obsessed with *Lunar Lander* as a kid since I kept on reading about it in video game magazines and I first played it at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island on Neptune Avenue near Surf Avenue. It was a vector graphics game where the whole object of the game was to land a lunar lander on some rocky surface; you scored points based on how difficult it was to reach a landing playform. The gameplay was frustrating since you could only spin the lunar lander left or right and fire a booster rocket to control descent. This all mimics what a real lander might have to do in the real world, but it always frustrated me and gave me a headache.

#### Missile Command (1980)

The first time I played *Missile Command* was at this arcade called *Captain’s Quarters* that opened up on Brighton Beach Avenue near Coney Island Avenue; just down the block from *Forty Thieves*. In fact it might have been the first game I ever played at *Forty Thieves*. The great appeal of the game was using the huge trackball to move your target acrosss the screen to intercept enemy missiles. The surreal part of the game is how you could never win and anytime you played it would just end with a hueg series of nuclear explosions appearing with the words, “The End” forming in the middle of it. Not a “feel good” for a kid growing up in the middle of the Cold War in the 1970s/1980s.

#### Moon Cresta (1980)

The first time I played *Moon Cresta* was in this discount store on Brighton Beach Avenue—near Coney Island Avenue—that was eventually called *Bertas* but had some generic sounding discount store name when I played this game there. The game setup for this game was weird since it was placed right next to the front windows of the store so you could see all of the old men and ladies walking back and forth—and waiting for the B68 or B1 bus—as you played. The game itself was cool since you could dock on later levels with bigger ships that would give you more firepower as the game went on. The graphics and enemies were kind of cool as well. But it got boring fairly quickly since it was one of many vertical space shooter games that came out at the time.

#### Moon Patrol (1982)

The first time I played *Moon Patrol* was at the *Forty Thieves* candy store on the corner of Brighton Beach Avenue and Coney Island Avenue. They had the machine outside of their store and facing Brighton Beach Avenue itself which made gameplay awkward—if not impossible—on bright and sunny days. The game itself was fun since it introduced the idea of jumping an driving as well as shooting aliens to the mix. Graphics and music were cool too.

#### Mr. Do (1982)

Of all of the games I ever played as a kid, *Mr. Do* was the one I was truly most obsessed with. I first played it at some candy store on Neptune Avenue near Brighton 6th or 5th street or something like that. This was literally the only arcade game they had in this small, well stocked, completely legit shop and they took good care of it. The owners would gladly provide kids with change for the machines and the kids would gladly buy some of the affordable snacks the shop had. I was obessed with *Mr. Do* because the gameplay was fast, the graphics were cute and while it was technically a *Dig Dug* clone, it was just much more fun to play. And there were all kinds of bonuses. I don’t remember the exact high scores I made, but was pretty high for a kid on an arcade machine in a dumpy neighborhood and othet kids were impressed so I was happy: Finally I could earn some level of basic respect from other neighborhood kids by playing a simple video game!

#### Ms. Pac Man (1981)

The first time I played *Ms. Pac-Man* was in Harrison, NJ. My sister and her family had moved to Harrison from Texas—where they used to live—and me and my dad were visiting Harrison at some point when I spotted a *Ms. Pac-Man* machine inside of a shop in a strip mall on our way to my sisters house. I don’t believe it was in an arcade, but I seem to recall it being setup right near the front of a laundromat or a pizza parlor or something like that. I begged my dad to go inside and play, and he relented. I only got to play one game, but my mind was blown: This game was better than I expected it to be based on video game magazine reviews/previews I read. Faster paced, more options more overall fun. Despite the fact I only played the game once it was the main topic of discussion I had with pretty much any adult I encoutered during the rest of the visit.

#### Phoenix (1980)

The first time I played *Phoenix* was in this discount store on Brighton Beach Avenue—near Coney Island Avenue—that was eventually called *Bertas* but had some generic sounding discount store name when I played this game there. The game setup for this game was weird since it was placed right next to the front windows of the store so you could see all of the old men and ladies walking back and forth—and waiting for the B68 or B1 bus—as you played. The game itself was fun since there were multiple levels and a “boss”-like level at the end where you had to destroy some floating space station that looked like the Comet Empire from *Star Blazers*. One odd memory I had of playing *Phoenix* was going up to the teenage cashier in front of the place when I needed change and she said bluntly, “No…” I was dejected enough that even when her co-worker explained I needed change to play the arcade games, I didn’t go back… I just walked out and walked home down Brighton Beach Avenue; blew some of that money on some comics at Nostrand Books before heading home.

#### Pole Position (1982)

I barely remember the first place I played *Pole Position*. Maybe it was  *Rainbow Lanes*, a bowling alley in Sheepshead Bay? Don’t know but leaving this here until the memory pops back into my head.

#### Robotron 2084 (1982)

The first time I played *Robotron 2084* was at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island on Neptune Avenue near Surf Avenue. The game was fun because coordinating between the left joystick that controlled your movement and the right joystick that controlled your firing direction was difficult to get a hang of but still a fun skill to learn. The onscreen graphics were also fluid and cool. And while the gameplay could get insane on higher levels, it was still a fun ride to be on.

#### Star Castle (1980)

The first time I played *Star Castle* was at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island on Neptune Avenue near Surf Avenue. This game got me hooked from the beginning. The vector graphics with just a small hint of color—thanks to color overlays—looked cool and the gameplay was very smooth. And since I liked bumper cars it was fun to bump the starship you controlled into the titular Star Castle’s shields. It was like *Asteroids* but just more fun.

#### Space Invaders (1978)

The first time I played *Space Invaders* was at the *Forty Thieves* candy store on the corner of Brighton Beach Avenue and Coney Island Avenue. It was one of three aracade games *Forty Thieves* had—*Gorf*, *Bite Monster (Pac-Man clone)* and *Space Invaders*—and utterly nobody played *Space Invaders* since it seemed old and out of date: *Gorf* was basicaly *Space Invaders* with more options/levels and *Bite Monster* was the star of the trio of games since everyone had *Pac-Man* fever or something like that. I did like one thing about *Space Invaders*: The sound design. The deep bass of the aliens thumping down across the screen and the sheer shimmering sound of lasers being fired was something unique that I never heard in any other video games of the time.

#### Star Wars (1983)

The first time I played *Star Wars* was at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island on Neptune Avenue near Surf Avenue. The machine was the sit-down model of the game so it cost 50 cents to play—instead of the 25 cents for the stand-up model—but it was well worth it to feel like you were in the cockpit of an X-Wing fighter. Destroying the Death Star was fun, but as each level progressed the game got boring. Maneuvering around towers on the Death Star’s surface on higher levels was fun, but past that it just played faster and faster of the same theme. How many times can you destroy the Death Star before you feel you can just go home already?

#### Starhawk (1977)

The first time I played *Star Hawk* was at some pizzeria on the Upper East Side or near Murray Hill or Kips Bay near the United Nations. My older brother was dragging me to some performance or some shit like that at the 92nd Street Y or something so we made a pit stop to get some food. Before we even entered the pizzeria, I spotted some store selling cool Japanese toys near where we parked and begged my brother to let me go in and check them out. He refused saying we were running late and we}d go there “Some other time…” or some bullshit like that so we just went to the pizzeria. When I walked inside the place, the pizzeria was like any other… But on one side there was this *Star Hawk* arcade game all the kids where hovering around. Nobody was playing it; they were just watching the “attract mode” screens. Me and my brother ordered some pizza and I made sure to finish my one measly slice before he did and asked, “Can I play the game over there?” He agreed but stated clearly, “We’re running late so make it quick.” I went over to the machine and started playing the game. It was basically tryinng to cash in on *Star Wars* with some endless trench run happening with random space ships popping up out of nowhere you had to shoot. The game kind of sucked, but it was fun to look at and even more fun with a group kids hovering around you. Soon, my brother was done and he came over and said gently, “We have to go…” but I was still playing… And doing pretty good at it as well. I kept on playing until he became belligerent about us having to leave to see whatever performance we were supposed to see and I basically left the machine in mid-game and let some other kids hovering around me play. It was good to see other kids smile and thank me, but that feeling disappeared as my brother rushed me angrilly out of the shop so we could go to whatever this performance was. To this day I barely rememeber what it was; may it was *Mummenschanz*? Don’t know and don’t care since my brother’s behavior and anger wiped away most any joy I could have gotten from the performance that day.

#### Tutankham (1982)

The first time I played *Tutankham* was at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island on Neptune Avenue near Surf Avenue. The game was fun but that’s about it.

#### Vanguard (1981)

The first time I played *Vanguard* was at some corner grocery store on Neptune Avenue near Brighton 2nd Street. Weird detail, but I remember it being after school and the day was overcast to the point it seemed like it was going to rain. The grocery wasn’t sketchy but was one of these “Meh…” groceries that you could tell was once a decent place that was now on it’s way out. *Vanguard* was fun to play since there was a controller that moved you across a moving screen and 4 buttons to fire lasers in 4 different directions. It was definitely fun and a bit addictive but it was also one of the first arcade games I knew of where there was a clear ending; no rolling over the game to the beginning. Getting to the end of the game was tough but it was fun to try to see how far I could get. I remember asking the clerk behind the counter for some change once and she gladly gave me 4 quarters and said a bit catatonically, “Is that game fun?” She seemed burned out but was young and all I said was “Yes!” and went back to playing the game.

#### Wizard of Wor (1980)

The first time I played *Wizard of Wor* was at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island on Neptune Avenue near Surf Avenue. The game was fun but that’s about it.

#### Xevious (1982)

First time I played *Xevious* was in this candy store on Neptune Avenue near Ocean Parkway; right near Lincoln High School. Pretty sure I first played it when I was going home after being let out on some day during my sophomore year in the school. The candy store was cool and had a few arcade games near the back. But the back of the store was kind of sketchy. I think they only had 3 video games in there at any given time and at one point even had *Dragon’s Lair* which was a big deal since it was a laserdisc video game thatw as completely animated and had no digital arcade-like characters in it.
