# Arcade Game Diary

This section is a placeholder for memories connected to arcade games I liked—and still like—dating from 1977 to 1985. At this point, it’s here mainly to motivate me to actually sit down and write about them already.

***

#### Asteroids (1979)

The first time I played *Asteroids* was in 1979 or 1980 at this arcade called *Captain’s Quarters* that opened up on Brighton Beach Avenue near Coney Island Avenue; just down the block from *Forty Thieves*.

#### Battlezone (1980)

I believe the first time I played *Battlezone* might have been in 1979 or 1980 at this arcade called *Captain’s Quarters* that opened up on Brighton Beach Avenue near Coney Island Avenue; just down the block from *Forty Thieves*. But another part of me seems to recall first playing this game in Coney Island at the *Faber’s Fascination* arcade on Surf Avenue near Neptune Avenue across the street from the subway station.

#### Berzerk (1980)

The first time I played *Berzerk* was in this discount store on Brighton Beach Avenue that was eventually called *Bertas* but had some generic sounding discount store name. It was weird since they spread out a few arcade games to wherever they could plug one in. And *Berzerk* was facing the far wall away from the windows—where other arcade games were setup—and away from the main entrance.

#### Bite Monster (Pac-Man clone) (1980)

*Bite Monster* was this weird—and aparently German made—*Pac-Man* clone they had at the *Forty Thieves* candy store on the corner of Brighton Beach Avenue and Coney Island Avenue. Gameplay was the same as *Pac-Man* but the game cabinet itself was a but junky. Like the joystick was really wobbly compared to even a real *Pac-Man* machine and the metal control panel where the joystick was placed was loose. So kids who put their quarters up on the console often had them slip behind that metal part which meant we had to complain to the store owner who would give a kid a new quarter but still complain about it. Until I saw a real *Pac-Man* machine, I always thought this game was called *Bite Monster*.

#### Boot Hill (1977)

The first actual video game I ever played. I spotted it at Nathan’s in Time Square on Broadway and 45th Street; the building now is the home to NASDAQ headquarters. Me and my dad were going to Nathan’s one day to check out the puppet show they had in the basement for kids. It was a pretty decent puppet show and every so often we would go; admission was free and I might score a hot dog. As we walked into to the building, I spotted *Boot Hill* near the front of the place and was basically hypnotized by it. Simple cowboy shootout setup with one gunner on one side of the screen and a gunner on the other. But it looked cool since it had some reflected background that was painted to look like some desolate old west town. The gameplay kinda sucked, but the whole experience felt cool and fun.

#### Bosconian (1981)

The first time I played this game was at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island on Neptune Avenue near Surf Avenue. The game was cool because you could explore and scroll through the small space scene the gameplay took place in. Destroying space stations was not cool. And sadly I was mugged by two other kids around my age on Henderson Walk just outside of the arcade as I was trying to go home. They basically just pushed me against the wall and threatened me, and I gave them the two measley dollars I had left. Walked back to the boardwalk and cried all the way home to Ocean Parkway.

#### Carnival (1980)

Played *Carnival* when I went on a trip to Vermont with some school friends and we stopped at a local arcade. The graphics of the game looked cool in the magazines I read, but the gameplay was stiff and a bit boring. Just like a shooting gallery, but in a video game form but with no prizes.

#### Centipede (1981)

Played *Centipede* for the first time at an arcade called *Captain’s Quarters* that opened up on Brighton Beach Avenue near Coney Island Avenue; just down the block from *Forty Thieves*. It was a fun game mainly because of the trackball; slamming it to roll rom side to side was a cool experience.

#### Defender (1980)

Played *Defender* for the first time at this sketchy storefront on Neptune Avenue around Brighton 3rd Street. It was sketchy because it was a small, dark storefront with utterly nothing else in the place but a soda machine, some random chairs and this arcade machine. It’s like some anti-social loser was friends with the owner of the building and they just let them open a crazy storefront just with one video game in it: *Defender*. The game was fun to play, but intense. What was also intense is most of the time me and friends would go inside to play it, there was seemingly nobody inside the store. One time we were playing it and this guy with blonde hair who looked a bit handsome—but a bit “junkie”-ish—came out from the back area of the store to stand behind us and say, “That’s a fun game, right?” And then would head back into the back of the store. The place never creeped me out enough for me to stop going there. What did get me to stop going there was just the fact that *Defender* was just too intense for me to deal with.

#### Donkey Kong (1981)

The first time I ever played *Donkey Kong* was at Met Food; the supermarket across the street from me on Brighton Beach Avenue and Ocean Parkway. I was walking down the block to head to either the library, toy store or bookstore and noticed the cabinent near the main entrance. I walked in and saw one a kid I knew in school, Aaron, playing the game. I looked over his shoulders and it looked cool. The characters seemed cool and it looked a little bit like Popeye. Aaron asked me as he was playing, “You ever play this before, Jack?” I shook my head to say “No…” and he kept on playing.  After he was done, he pulled out some pre-printed sports gambling pad he had in is pocket. “Do you like football, Jack?” I turned to him and said “No…” and with that he put the pad back in his pocket, said goodbye to me and headed outside. After he left, I took a quarter out of my pocket and tossed it in the machine to play *Donkey Kong* myself. The game was fun, but it seemed repetetive.

#### Donkey Kong Jr. (1982)

The first time I played *Donkey Kong Jr.* was at the Kings Plaza Mall which was located deep in Brooklyn near Canarsie in this neighborhood called Mill Basin. The game was one of many new games at the mall’s smallish, unenclosed arcade which was basically just a row of arcade machines near a Roy Rogers or some fast food place like that.

#### The Empire Strikes Back (1985)

The first time I played *The Empire Strikes Back* was at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island on Neptune Avenue near Surf Avenue. Pretty certain it was the stand up model of the game. It had simialr vector graphics to what the original *Star Wars* game had, but this game was way more fun. Being able to fly through the legs of AT-AT’s was really great and one of the most fun 3D game experiences I ever had.

#### Firefox (1982)

The first time I played *Firefox* was at the Astroland arcade which was on West 10th Street near Neptune Avenue in Coney Island; right across the way from the *Dante’s Inferno* dark ride. It was an outdoor arcade that had some kind of overhead shade, but otherwise was wide open and you could just walk through it without hassle. The game looked cool since it used actual footage from the motion picture it was based on, but the gameplay kind of sucked. I remember playing the game and Victor—this guy who was older than me who was the son of my mom’s friend in the building—spotted me and said, “These games are fun, right?” I nodded in agreement and he walked off to hang out with a friend of his (William?) who would hang out on the boardwalk and oggle the girls on the beach via a telephoto lens camera one of them had. Family friends but kind of creepy, right?

#### Gauntlet (1985)

The first time I ever played *Gauntlet* was at a drug store in Midwood on the corner of Coney Island Aveneue and Avenue J. The drugstore was right outside of the B68 bus stop so this game was the perfect way to waste some time. And it was pretty cool since it was the first arcade game I knew of where multiple people (up to 4) can play at the same time and work cooperatively to reach a goal. It was a bit of an “evil” game since your character didn’t die, but would lose “health” by being attacked and you could boost your health by sticking another quarter in. Fun game, but it seemed endless and tossing quarters into it endlessly got to be annoying after a while.

#### Gorf (1981)

*Gorf* was a great value of a junior high school kid with limited funds who wanted to play a variety of games for a single quarter. The first time I played it was at the *Forty Thieves* candy store on the corner of Brighton Beach Avenue and Coney Island Avenue. It was one of three games they had at the time: *Space Invaders*, *Bite Monster (Pac-Man Clone)* and *Gorf*. *Gorf* was fun to play since it had five levels, started off like *Space Invaders* and had a level later on that was just like *Galaxian*. It’s weird this candy store would have *Gorf* and *Space Invaders* since why would anyone play *Space Invaders* when they could play *Gorf* instead. The game also talked to you to taunt you and the controller was a joystick with a trigger on it that looked/felt like a fighter pilot’s control stick. The one thing that did stink about *Gorf* is how unsmooth the gameplay was; it was like it was programmed in some clunky language like Forth or something and never optimized for speed.
