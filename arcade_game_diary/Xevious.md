## Xevious (1982)

By Jack Szwergold

First time I played *Xevious* was in this candy store on Neptune Avenue near Ocean Parkway; right near Lincoln High School. Pretty sure I first played it when I was going home after being let out on some day during my sophomore year in the school. The candy store was cool and had a few arcade games near the back. But the back of the store was kind of sketchy. I think they only had 3 video games in there at any given time and at one point even had *Dragonâ€™s Lair* which was a big deal since it was a laserdisc video game that was completely animated and had no digital arcade-like characters in it.
