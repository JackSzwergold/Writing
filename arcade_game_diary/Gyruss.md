## Gyruss (1983)

By Jack Szwergold

*Gyruss* was a cool clone of *Tempest* that used raster graphics instead of vector graphics. It was fun since the gameplay also felt like a 3D version of *Galaga*. I am not 100% on where I first played *Gyruss* but I am pretty sure it was at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island… But part of me thinks I first played the game in the student union building at Brooklyn College; the basement of the place had a full-on arcade with all kinds of cool games like *The Empire Strikes Back*, *Gyruss*, *Mappy* and even that creepy shooting game *Chiller*.
