## Star Castle (1980)

By Jack Szwergold

The first time I played *Star Castle* was at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island on Neptune Avenue near Surf Avenue. This game got me hooked from the beginning. The vector graphics with just a small hint of color—thanks to color overlays—looked cool and the gameplay was very smooth. And since I liked bumper cars it was fun to bump the starship you controlled into the titular Star Castle’s shields. It was like *Asteroids* but just more fun.
