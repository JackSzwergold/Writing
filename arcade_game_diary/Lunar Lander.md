## Lunar Lander (1979)

By Jack Szwergold

I was a little bit obsessed with *Lunar Lander* as a kid since I kept on reading about it in video game magazines and I first played it at *Faberâ€™s Fascination* in Coney Island on Neptune Avenue near Surf Avenue. It was a vector graphics game where the whole object of the game was to land a lunar lander on some rocky surface; you scored points based on how difficult it was to reach a landing platform. The gameplay was frustrating since you could only spin the lunar lander left or right and fire a booster rocket to control descent. This all mimics what a real lander might have to do in the real world, but it always frustrated me and gave me a headache.
