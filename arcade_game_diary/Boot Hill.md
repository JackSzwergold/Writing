## Boot Hill (1977)

By Jack Szwergold

The first actual video game I ever played. I spotted it at Nathan’s in Time Square on Broadway and 45th Street; the building now is the home to NASDAQ headquarters. Me and my dad were going to Nathan’s one day to check out the puppet show they had in the basement for kids. It was a pretty decent puppet show and every so often we would go; admission was free and I might score a hot dog. As we walked into to the building, I spotted *Boot Hill* near the front of the place and was basically hypnotized by it. Simple cowboy shootout setup with one gunner on one side of the screen and a gunner on the other. But it looked cool since it had some reflected background that was painted to look like some desolate old west town. The gameplay kinda sucked, but the whole experience felt cool and fun.
