## Star Wars (1983)

By Jack Szwergold

The first time I played *Star Wars* was at *Faber’s Fascination* in Coney Island on Neptune Avenue near Surf Avenue. The machine was the sit-down model of the game so it cost 50 cents to play—instead of the 25 cents for the stand-up model—but it was well worth it to feel like you were in the cockpit of an X-Wing fighter. Destroying the Death Star was fun, but as each level progressed the game got boring. Maneuvering around towers on the Death Star’s surface on higher levels was fun, but past that it just played faster and faster of the same theme. How many times can you destroy the Death Star before you feel you can just go home already?
