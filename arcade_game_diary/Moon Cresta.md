## Moon Cresta (1980)

By Jack Szwergold

The first time I played *Moon Cresta* was in this discount store on Brighton Beach Avenue—near Coney Island Avenue—that was eventually called *Bertas* but had some generic sounding discount store name when I played this game there. The game setup for this game was weird since it was placed right next to the front windows of the store so you could see all of the old men and ladies walking back and forth—and waiting for the B68 or B1 bus—as you played. The game itself was cool since you could dock on later levels with bigger ships that would give you more firepower as the game went on. The graphics and enemies were kind of cool as well. But it got boring fairly quickly since it was one of many vertical space shooter games that came out at the time.
