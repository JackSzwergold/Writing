## Phoenix (1980)

By Jack Szwergold

The first time I played *Phoenix* was in this discount store on Brighton Beach Avenue—near Coney Island Avenue—that was eventually called *Bertas* but had some generic sounding discount store name when I played this game there. The game setup for this game was weird since it was placed right next to the front windows of the store so you could see all of the old men and ladies walking back and forth—and waiting for the B68 or B1 bus—as you played. The game itself was fun since there were multiple levels and a “boss”-like level at the end where you had to destroy some floating space station that looked like the Comet Empire from *Star Blazers*. One odd memory I had of playing *Phoenix* was going up to the teenage cashier in front of the place when I needed change and she said bluntly, “No…” I was dejected enough that even when her co-worker explained I needed change to play the arcade games, I didn’t go back… I just walked out and walked home down Brighton Beach Avenue; blew some of that money on some comics at Nostrand Books before heading home.
