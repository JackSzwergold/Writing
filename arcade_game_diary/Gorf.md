## Gorf (1981)

By Jack Szwergold

*Gorf* was a great value of a junior high school kid with limited funds who wanted to play a variety of games for a single quarter. The first time I played it was at the *Forty Thieves* candy store on the corner of Brighton Beach Avenue and Coney Island Avenue. It was one of three games they had at the time: *Space Invaders*, *Bite Monster (Pac-Man Clone)* and *Gorf*. *Gorf* was fun to play since it had five levels, started off like *Space Invaders* and had a level later on that was just like *Galaxian*. It’s weird this candy store would have *Gorf* and *Space Invaders* since why would anyone play *Space Invaders* when they could play *Gorf* instead. The game also talked to you to taunt you and the controller was a joystick with a trigger on it that looked/felt like a fighter pilot’s control stick. The one thing that did stink about *Gorf* is how unsmooth the gameplay was; it was like it was programmed in some clunky language like Forth or something and never optimized for speed.
