## Donkey Kong Jr. (1982)

By Jack Szwergold

The first time I played *Donkey Kong Jr.* was at the Kings Plaza Mall which was located deep in Brooklyn near Canarsie in this neighborhood called Mill Basin. The game was one of many new games at the mallâ€™s smallish, unenclosed arcade which was basically just a row of arcade machines near a Roy Rogers or some fast food place like that.
