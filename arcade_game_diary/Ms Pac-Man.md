## Ms. Pac-Man (1981)

By Jack Szwergold

The first time I played *Ms. Pac-Man* was in Harrison, NJ. My sister and her family had moved to Harrison from Texas—where they used to live—and me and my dad were visiting Harrison at some point when I spotted a *Ms. Pac-Man* machine inside of a shop in a strip mall on our way to my sisters house. I don’t believe it was in an arcade, but I seem to recall it being setup right near the front of a laundromat or a pizza parlor or something like that. I begged my dad to go inside and play, and he relented. I only got to play one game, but my mind was blown: This game was better than I expected it to be based on video game magazine reviews/previews I read. Faster paced, more options more overall fun. Despite the fact I only played the game once it was the main topic of discussion I had with pretty much any adult I encountered during the rest of the visit.
