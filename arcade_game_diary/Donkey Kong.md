## Donkey Kong (1981)

By Jack Szwergold

The first time I ever played *Donkey Kong* was at Met Food; the supermarket across the street from me on Brighton Beach Avenue and Ocean Parkway. I was walking down the block to head to either the library, toy store or bookstore and noticed the cabinet near the main entrance. I walked in and saw one a kid I knew in school, Aaron, playing the game. I looked over his shoulders and it looked cool. The characters seemed cool and it looked a little bit like Popeye. Aaron asked me as he was playing, “You ever play this before, Jack?” I shook my head to say “No…” and he kept on playing.  After he was done, he pulled out some pre-printed sports gambling pad he had in is pocket. “Do you like football, Jack?” I turned to him and said “No…” and with that he put the pad back in his pocket, said goodbye to me and headed outside. After he left, I took a quarter out of my pocket and tossed it in the machine to play *Donkey Kong* myself. The game was fun, but it seemed repetitive.
