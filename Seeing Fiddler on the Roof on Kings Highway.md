# Seeing *Fiddler on the Roof* on King’s Highway
## The Time My Parents and I Went Out to See the Film

By Jack Szwergold, April 19, 2016

My parents never really went out. The biggest family trips we made were shopping in the neighborhood, shopping outside of the neighborhood, going to the beach to sit around, going to the park to sit around or walking on the boardwalk to—eventually—sit around. That’s about it. But one weekend in the winter of 1979, things were different.

We all got dressed up and headed to King’s Highway. I asked if we were going shopping and my dad said not really. That was weird. I was hoping we’d go shopping since I knew of a few good shops around King’s Highway where I could buy whatever bullshit my 11 year old eye would latch onto with whatever meager allowance savings I had at the time.

Anyway we left our building and headed to the subway station at Ocean Parkway. The train ride wasn’t that long, about 5-6 stops, but this all felt slightly religious in a weird way. Like we were going to Church or something—which is weird for a Jewish kid to say—but it all felt more formal than the few times I remember going to Temple as a kid. I wasn’t exactly dressed in a suit and tie, but I was wearing a button down shirt that was tucked in and some black shoes I only wore during formal events; no sneakers, t-shirt and jeans this time out because this wasn’t some random shopping trip.

We got off at King’s Highway and started to walk westward, towards Ocean Avenue, which was weird too. Whenever we headed to King’s Highway we usually stayed around the area between Coney Island Avenue and the train station that was located between East 15th Street and East 16th Street. Not on this trip. We were headed to a movie theater. It wasn’t the Kingsway Theater on Coney Island Avenue but another one near East 18th Street that was called the Avalon Theater or something like that.

Anyway when we got to the theater, there was a crowd outside. No kids around my age that I could see but tons—and I mean *tons*—of older Jewish people around my parent’s age. My dad got us the tickets and we headed inside.

It was dark and crowded and I never even asked what movie we were seeing or paid attention to the marquee or posters outside the theater. It didn’t matter much because I was bored, really didn’t want to see a movie and just wanted to sit down and fidget. When I finally sat down and looked around, the theater was stunning in all kinds of nice little ways. This was at that time in the 1970s before they split up movie theaters into crappy multiplexes to squeeze more money out of them. Lots of red velvet curtains, gold trimming and nice lighting details. After waiting a little bit—and without much warning—the lights went down, the red curtains were pulled back and the glowing movie screen was finally revealed to us.

And the film we were going to see was *Fiddler on to Roof*. I knew some of the music from the soundtrack LP my parents had at home. But unlike the scratchy sound coming out of our clunky record player, the music and sound here were relatively crystal clear… I mean as crystal clear as a 1970s film soundtrack can sound as it’s being pumped through a crappy old theater sound system goes.

At this point I should say something about how the film entranced me and swept me away or some bullshit like that. But the reality is as good as the film was/is, I was just a kid at the time I saw it and I was bored.

We sat in a row with an aisle in front of us so I stood up during most of the film and fidgeted around on the railing as if it were a monkey bar in a playground. Everyone else in the theater was silently watching—and taking in—the film. And when the scene on the screen was bright enough I liked to turn around and see the faces on the crowd all lit up by the reflected projector light. It was—for all intents and purposes—a crowd of all old people… Old Jewish people… Old Jewish people watching a modern Jewish film about an old Jewish way of life in an old movie theater in an old Jewish neighborhood in Brooklyn. And me mixed in the middle of it all; the seemingly only kid in the crowd.

Then—at one point in the film—everyone seemed to come to life when the characters in the film began to sing “Sunrise, Sunset.” The moment that song appeared in the film, suddenly all of the old Jewish folks in the theater sang in unison without anyone prodding them or coaching them on what to sing or how to sing it. I didn’t really sing along but my parents did. It’s one of the first—and only—times I remember watching them sing anything together, let alone singing a song like this out in public.

I have no idea at what point in the movie that scene happened, but all I remember was watching the rest of the movie unfold and then it ended. The lights came on, the curtain closed on the screen, and everybody got up and went home. Some people talked,and others just left and went on with their day. As for me and my parents, we walked back to the train station, climbed up the stairs and waited for the next train to arrive to take us back home.

Of all of the weird things about that day, one thing has always struck me: At no point did my mom or dad make an effort to shop for stuff before or after the film. We simply went to see the film and that was that.
