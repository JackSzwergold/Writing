# Seeing *Fiddler on the Roof* on King’s Highway
## The Time My Parents and I Went Out to See the Film

By Jack Szwergold, April 19, 2016

My parents never really went out. The biggest family trips we made were shopping in the neighborhood, shopping outside of the neighborhood, going to the beach to sit around, going to the park to sit around or walking on the boardwalk to—eventually—sit around. That’s about it. But one weekend in the winter of 1979, things were different.

We all got dressed up and headed to King’s Highway. I asked if we were going shopping and my dad said not really. That was weird. I was hoping we’d go shopping since I knew of a few good shops around King’s Highway where I could buy whatever bullshit my 11 year old eye would latch onto with whatever meager allowance savings I had at the time.

Anyway we left the building and headed to the train station. The subway ride wasn’t long, about 5-6 stops, but this all felt slightly religious. Like we were going to Church or something. Which is weird for a Jewish kid to say but it all felt more formal than the few times I remember going to Temple as a kid. I wasn’t exactly dressed in a suit and tie, but I was wearing a button down shirt that was tucked in and some black shoes I only wore during formal events. This wasn’t some random shopping trip.

We got off at King’s Highway and started to walk westward, towards Ocean Avenue, which was weird too. Whenever we headed to King’s Highway we usually stayed around the area between Coney Island Avenue and the train station on East 15th Street. Not this trip. We were headed to a movie theater. It wasn’t the Kingsway Theater on Coney Island Avenue but another one near East 18th Street.

Anyway when we got to the theater, there was a crowd outside. No kids that I could see but tons of older Jewish people around my parent’s age. My dad got the tickets and we headed inside.

It was dark and crowded and I never even asked what movie we were seeing. It didn’t matter much because I was bored and just wanted to sit down. When I finally sat down and looked around, the theater was all kinds of stunning. This was at that time in the 1970s before they split up movie theaters into multiplexes to squeeze more money out of them. Lots of red velvet curtains and gold trimming. Suddenly the lights went down and the curtain opened.

The film was *Fiddler on to Roof*. I knew some of the music from the soundtrack LP my parents had at home. But unlike the scratchy sound coming out of our clunky record player, the music and sound here was crystal clear.

I should say something about how the film entranced me and swept me away or some shit like that. But the reality is I was a kid and I was bored. We sat in a row with an aisle in front of us so I stood up during most of the film and fidgeted around on the raising as if it were a monkey bar in a playground. Everyone was silently watching and when the scene was bright enough on the screen I liked to turn around and see the faces on to crowd. It was all old people. Old Jewish people. And me mixed in it; the seemingly only kid in the crowd.

Then at one moment in the film, everyone seemed to come to life when it came time to sing “Sunrise, Sunset.” At that moment, suddenly all of the faces in the crowd sang in unison without anyone prodding or coaching. I didn’t really sing along but my parents did. It’s one of the first times I remember watching them sing together, let alone in public.

I have no idea at what point in the movie that scene happened, but all I remember was watching the rest of the movie unfold and then it ended. The lights came on, the curtain closed on the screen, and everybody got up and went home. Some people talked,and others just left and went on with their day. As for me and my parents, we walked back to the train station, climbed up the stairs and waited for the next train to arrive to take us back home.

Of all of the weird things about that day, one thing has always struck me: At no point did my mom or dad make an effort to shop for stuff before or after the film. We simply went to see the film and that was that.
