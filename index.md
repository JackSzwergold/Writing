# Writing

This is where I post and share writing related stuff. Basically non-technical, creative fiction and non-fiction stuff. A breakdown of what’s what is below.


## [Memories][1]

Here are **[some personal memories of mine][1]**; written down for all to read. Pretty much everything in there at this point relates to my experiences growing up in Brooklyn, New York. But I’m not calling it a “memoir” just yet because that word is a tad pompous and pretentious; but honestly **[that’s what it might be at this point][1]**.

## [Dreams][2]

This is where I share and **[post notes on dreams I’ve had][2]**. Most of the time my dreams are… Meh. And sometimes my dreams stick with me. Here are **[notes on those dreams][2]**.
