# Writing an Angry Letter to George Lucas (Not Seeing Return of the Jedi for a Third Time)

By Jack Szwergold, June 18, 2015

I had a chance to see *Return of the Jedi* with my brother but didn’t take it. Why? Easy. I was tired of of my brother’s psychological abuse and bullshit.

For some perspective, my brother was nearly 20 years older than me and—while I really didn’t grow up with him—he took on the unwanted, self-proclaimed “noble burden” to be some bizarre “savior” of my supposedly “bad” childhood.

What was the “bad” my brother was supposedly “saving” me from in my life? Apparently he perceived my childhood as being “deprived” because my parents were old enough to be my grandparents, our family was poor and we were not religiously Jewish enough for his personal taste.

The reality is all of his concerns were utter bullshit: He simply hated his own parents for various nonsensical, trivial reasons and acted out many of his delusional insecurities via his supposed “concerns” for my welfare and well being.

Which is all to say that as an adult, that is how I now understand his unwanted, domineering, destructive and dysfunctional behavior. As a child, I just felt his behavior was just bullshit and I wasn’t going to endure sitting through yet another *Star Wars* film with him for any reason.

When I saw *Star Wars* with my brother he was indignant about me having already seen it before. And when we went to see *The Empire Strikes Back* he was constantly calling me “stupid” for tenuous reasons at best. There was no way I was going to deal with that childish bullshit from someone nearly 20 years older than me when it came time to see *Return of the Jedi*.

“You like *Star Wars*? Right? Then why don’t you want to see it?” he asked on the phone. “I saw it last week,” I responded. “Then you can see it again?” he responded and then I responded, “No, I don’t want to see it.” Then the pregnant pause came which meant that at any moment he would either explode screaming manipulative, verbally abusive nonsense or accept my choice and move on.

Happily this time he didn’t explode screaming. But what he said next was new, unexpected and—in many ways—worse.

“But this time you can see it with you nephew.” My response again was “No, I already saw it,” but this time there was a pang of guilt in my heart about this. I was a young kid who was barely 15 years old, but here is my older brother adding some guilt to the mix by implying that I should go to see *Return of the Jedi* again because it would a “nice” thing to do for his son; my nephew. He was literally using his own son—who would have been too young to even remember or care about the experience—as some kind of pawn in his game to get me to go with him to see *Return of the Jedi*. But I wasn’t budging; my answer was the same as before, “No.” And with that I passed the phone back to my dad so they could talk about whatever they were going to talk about.

As they talked on the phone, I went back into my room, closed the door and went back to doing whatever I was doing.

A week or so passed and I hadn’t heard anything new about *Return of the Jedi* from my brother. Which was a relief until he called one night to talk to our parents about something and wanted to speak to me.

So I walked to the hallway, picked up the telephone receiver and simply said “Hello.” What followed was a fairly incomprehensible explosion of bullshit about how *Return of the Jedi* apparently frightened my brother’s son and how he was going to personally write a letter to George Lucas to complain about it.

“This movie is supposed to be for the children!!!” he screamed to me as he explained how his son was so frightened by the Rancor beast in Jabba the Hutt’s Palace—the one that was going to eat Luke Skywalker—that his son screamed and cried. “We had to leave! He was crying so much!” he continued blabbering like an out of control machine gun, never giving me a second to say anything past that initial “Hello.” This went on for a few minutes as I tried to have whatever kind of conversation a kid can have when a screaming, incomprehensible asshole who is 20 years older than you is on the other end of the phone.

After a minute or so, my brother’s indignant pace calmed down enough for me to simply say, “I don’t think that it was scary.” And again, my brother revved himself up to complain about how that one scene with the Rancor beast was so horrible, so terrifying that he was going to write a letter to George Lucas about it. I simply responded, “Okay,” and passed the phone back to my dad.

As they talked on the phone, I went back to my room and noticed the sunset. So I found my keys, went outside and took a walk on the boardwalk before it got too dark. At least now I could get some fresh air and clear my head of all of this nonsense—and real-world rancor—that was bitterly spewed into my head.
