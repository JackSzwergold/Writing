# A Blurry, Indignant Headache (The Second Time I Saw Star Wars)

By Jack Szwergold, May 23, 2015

I had already seen *Star Wars* in summer camp a few weeks before when my brother—who is 20 years older than me—impulsively came by our home in Brighton Beach one weekend to take me and “a friend” to see *Star Wars*.

He wanted to take me to see *Star Wars* but was oblivious to the fact I had already seen it. And like everything he did to “improve people’s lives,” he came in like a hurricane of good intentions wrapped in thunderstorm of utter, headache-inducing, dysfunctional cluelessness.

And I say “friend” in quotes since my brother had bizarre ideas of who my friends were and whose choice it was to choose which “friend” was dragged along on these “special” trips. Meaning he’d show up without warning, I’d have to grab a “friend” from the neighborhood as quickly as possible, we would all go somewhere “special” and we’d all have “fun.” At the end of the day, it was definitely a “special” thing to do. But it was not “special” in the way he thought it to be and the activity was rarely as much “fun” as he thought it was as well.

So this time he decided to take me and my pal Howie from down the block to see *Star Wars*. Why Howie? Not sure and not complaining since Howie was cool and I liked him. But it seemed like the choice to take Howie along was based solely on the fact Howie was hanging outside his building at that moment we walked by and not much else.

With that decision made by him—and only him—and without even asking us if we had seen the film we were swept up, placed in whatever crappy car he had back then—a Ford Pinto, I think?—and off we went to see *Star Wars*.

We headed into Manhattan to the Loews Astor Plaza in Times Square since it was the only theater in the city playing *Star Wars*. All along the way my brother was telling us about how much we would like the film and how it was a “sleeper hit” or some nonsense like that. This was before the days of portable stereos, Walkman’s and iPods so all we could do is sit and listen to this rambling bullshit while classical music from WQXR or WNYC played in the background and he occasionally yelled at traffic.

When we got to the theater, we ran in, found some seats, sat down and the film started. Howie and I got into to the film, but not as intently as someone first seeing it. It was still fresh in our young memories so seeing it again so soon after first seeing it wasn’t as exciting as seeing it the first time. But at least there was some excitement at being able to see key scenes—like the battle scenes—again.

My brother interpreted our very noticeable boredom as somehow meaning we required his rambling narrative. So he would painfully, slowly and patronizingly explain some of the action on screen as if we were some special case kids who suffered from attention deficit disorder. Not knowing how to respond to this, Howie and I both nodded and continued to watch the film.

I’m not too sure what exact scene it happened—maybe when Ben Kenobi rescues Luke from the Sand People?—but early on into film the Howie and I said something to each other about that specific scene which clearly indicated that we already knew what was happening.

My brother picked up on the *Star Wars* conversation Howie and I were having and snapped at us in the middle of the theater saying something along the lines of, “You saw this film before?!? When?!? Why didn’t you tell me?!?” I don’t know what Howie said but I said I saw it in camp. My brother was still indignant and clearly agitated by the discovery and basically made us kids feel uncomfortable for the rest of the film. It seems he didn’t want to take us to see *Star Wars* again, but in his mind he was taking us “poor needy kids” to see *Star Wars* for the first time.

Needless to say Howie and I technically got to see the film again which was definitely a big deal in those days before cable TV and video rental stores. But past the first 1/2 hour or so—at least until the final Death Star battle—it was all a stressful blur thanks my brother’s dysfunctional expectations and behavior.

The car ride heading back to Brooklyn wasn’t pleasant thanks to my brother—a full grown adult—still obsessively asking about how and when we saw *Star Wars*. Being interrogated over something as trivial as that in a car was far from fun, but it didn’t matter to my brother. It simply made no sense to him that kids in a poor neighborhood could have somehow seen a film like *Star Wars* without the help of someone like him.

We finally got back to Brighton Beach around sunset. After we all got out of the car I decided to hang out with Howie in front of his building. Some other neighborhood kids were out there so we could all kill some time and I could decompress a bit before it got too dark.

My brother said I should go back home and I told him I was going to play with Howie and the other kids for a while. Stubborn and not one to take no for an answer, he insisted that I go back home to at least have some food for dinner and go out later but I refused. I knew mom and dad would always have some food set aside for me no matter what. So my brother locked his car, went back home and I played out in the street for a bit.

Although the sun was setting and it would be dark in a half hour or so, playing in the street, throwing a ball around, drawing on the sidewalk and horsing around with friends washed away some of the stress of the afternoon. I got to see *Star Wars* again, but the only lasting memory of it was a blurry, indignant headache.
